# CastingCompass geospatial ML pipeline

This directory contains a reproducible, leakage-aware foundation for learning
seafloor representations and, once suitable labels exist, modeling
recreational-fishing occurrence and positive-catch CPUE. Downloaded government
rasters and model checkpoints are intentionally ignored by Git. No catch-skill
claim is made from self-supervised bathymetry training.

## Lightweight smoke test

The smoke path uses only NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. It creates a fictional
UTM raster and fictional catch records, then exercises terrain derivation,
patch extraction, spatially blocked folds, three baselines, four ablations, and
versioned run metadata.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli smoke \
  --output-dir /tmp/contourcast-smoke \
  --seed 42

python3 -m unittest discover -s pipeline/tests -v
```

Any numbers under the smoke output are synthetic plumbing-test results, not
habitat, fishing, or model-quality claims.

## Historical v1 site-window validation — do not activate

The commands in this section are retained to reproduce and test the frozen v1
design. They are **not** the production activation path. V1 depends on an
external per-event transparency-log verifier and independent publication
service that do not exist, so its activation is permanently closed. The current
successor is the non-performance collection pilot in
`docs/VALIDATION-SUCCESSOR.md`. Verify its local contracts with:

```bash
npm run verify:validation-successor
```

V2 still requires runtime capture, privacy/legal/data-steward approval, an OSF
registration, storage/restore evidence, and a sealed activation manifest before
the first eligible row. No command below satisfies those gates.

The first-party validation path is separate from terrain-point ingestion. It
can evaluate only the frozen California-halibut curated-site by authoritative
two-hour-window claim. It cannot substantiate probability, biological absence,
precise casting-zone, causal, safety, access, regulatory, or other-species
claims. All inputs and outputs below are private local artifacts and are not
production evidence by themselves.

Production first needs an externally allowlisted Ed25519 exporter/publication
key, a tamper-evident pre-enrollment activation commitment, a trusted server
clock, and append-only proof that the signer issued each full immutable
score/site/window/snapshot/recruitment/consent payload at impression time. A
public key merely declared inside its own unsigned activation manifest proves
internal consistency, not server provenance; neither an arbitrary digest nor a
terminal after-outcome census proves prospective issuance. Seal the empty
activation with the deployed scoring identity; seal times come only from the
trusted clock and cannot be supplied by the caller:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli seal-validation-activation \
  --protocol validation/protocols/california-halibut-site-window-v1.json \
  --release-commit FULL_CONTAINING_COMMIT \
  --scoring-system-kind heuristic-configuration \
  --scoring-system-version heuristic-california-halibut-SHA256 \
  --scoring-system-sha256 SHA256 \
  --opportunity-contract-version castingcompass.opportunity/2.0.0 \
  --validation-export-signing-key-id EXTERNALLY_ALLOWLISTED_KEY_ID \
  --validation-export-public-key-ed25519 BASE64_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY \
  --external-log-anchor-provider-id EXTERNALLY_ALLOWLISTED_ANCHOR_PROVIDER \
  --external-log-anchor-signing-key-id DISTINCT_EXTERNAL_ANCHOR_KEY_ID \
  --external-log-anchor-public-key-ed25519 DISTINCT_BASE64_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY \
  --output PRIVATE_ACTIVATION.json
```

Assignment sealing accepts an exact, deidentified, label-free JSON/JSONL
envelope. Outcome fields, unknown fields, direct identifiers, reporter hashes,
notes, photos, and coordinates are rejected. Every prospective row must carry
the canonical `castingcompass.validation-impression-attestation/1.0.0`
Ed25519 envelope signed by the activation-pinned key. The evaluator reconstructs
and exactly matches its ordinal score, site/window, model snapshot, recruitment,
consent/intent, cohort, selection-audit, and activation identities, then checks
its pre-outcome time and signature. Python and Worker share
`contracts/fixtures/impression-attestation-vector.json`. The strict companion
opportunity ledger and candidate-prediction JSON files must exactly cover every
prospective assignment. Each manifest assignment freezes the full label-free
row hash, exact candidate-prediction hash, and ordinal score. Supply every prior
manifest in sequence; each batch is cumulative, preserves all earlier
assignment objects byte-semantically, and creates a new chain link.

Primary score exposure is a separate signed event. The assignment attestation
first proves that the score was not yet exposed; if the product later displays
it, a linked first-exposure envelope records the actual time. Only exposure
strictly before effort starts can appear in a sealed prospective row. Exposure
at or after effort start is retained only in terminal reconciliation and is
never backfilled into the row. Safe cancellation remains an issued, unsealed
terminal disposition rather than a negative outcome.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli seal-validation-splits \
  --label-free-evidence PRIVATE_LABEL_FREE_EVIDENCE.jsonl \
  --opportunity-ledger PRIVATE_OPPORTUNITY_LEDGER.json \
  --predictions PRIVATE_CANDIDATE_PREDICTIONS.json \
  --manifest-chain PRIVATE_ACTIVATION.json PRIVATE_BATCH_1.json \
  --output PRIVATE_BATCH_2.json
```

After the fixed interval, an activation-key-signed trusted census must bind
every accepted row to one consecutive `export_ordinal` and its completion event
and reconcile every issued assignment, every signed primary exposure event, and every terminal
disposition through one exact millisecond-aligned watermark. Missing issuance
and unmatched exposure counts must be zero, including for an honest zero-row
interval. The local artifact is still only a signed exporter assertion, not
independent append-only-log proof. Seal finalization only after that census;
the finalization freezes the clean source tree, exact Python 3.12 direct and
transitive dependency lock (including `cffi` and `pycparser`), immutable
runtime-image digest, census, and final assignment batch.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli seal-validation-finalization \
  --label-free-evidence PRIVATE_LABEL_FREE_EVIDENCE.jsonl \
  --opportunity-ledger PRIVATE_OPPORTUNITY_LEDGER.json \
  --predictions PRIVATE_CANDIDATE_PREDICTIONS.json \
  --census-export SIGNED_TERMINAL_CENSUS.json \
  --manifest-chain PRIVATE_ACTIVATION.json PRIVATE_BATCH_1.json PRIVATE_BATCH_2.json \
  --output PRIVATE_FINALIZATION.json
```

The trusted service then supplies a cumulative signed exclusion, withdrawal,
and deletion ledger together with the complete manifest chain. Every later
ledger strictly advances its timestamps, preserves the prior assignment/event
prefix exactly, and appends events after the predecessor reconciliation
watermark. Exclusion may advance to withdrawal or deletion, withdrawal may
advance only to deletion, and deletion is terminal. Reports preserve both the
first analytical removal and the latest privacy state.
Before labels can be requested, revalidate the frozen evaluator and seal the
exact next label-lock link:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli seal-validation-label-lock \
  --manifest-chain PRIVATE_ACTIVATION.json PRIVATE_BATCH_1.json PRIVATE_BATCH_2.json PRIVATE_FINALIZATION.json \
  --output PRIVATE_LABEL_LOCK.json
```

Only after receiving that lock may the trusted exporter issue a signed labeled
export bound to the exact lock and final deletion ledger. The evaluator opens
those held bytes once, writes a receipt before parsing, selects the baseline on
blocks 1–2, predicts every held geography in blocks 3–4, and runs the fixed
2,000-replicate global participant-cluster bootstrap. Each participant's rows
stay together across every panel and block. Unique-group, Kish effective-group,
outcome-class concentration, geography, and temporal-block gates fail to
inconclusive without dropping rows. Secondary source/design results are
descriptive only; there are no secondary hypothesis tests or Holm adjustment.

Because the current census carries no independently verified append-only-log
proof, this invocation emits only a nonpublishable unpublished draft. It
returns `withheld-pending-independent-append-only-log-proof` and creates no
publication request or receipt:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli evaluate-site-window \
  --label-free-evidence PRIVATE_LABEL_FREE_EVIDENCE.jsonl \
  --labeled-evidence PRIVATE_LABELED_EVIDENCE.jsonl \
  --opportunity-ledger PRIVATE_OPPORTUNITY_LEDGER.json \
  --predictions PRIVATE_CANDIDATE_PREDICTIONS.json \
  --census-export SIGNED_TERMINAL_CENSUS.json \
  --deletion-reconciliation SIGNED_DELETION_0.json SIGNED_DELETION_1.json \
  --manifest-chain PRIVATE_ACTIVATION.json PRIVATE_BATCH_1.json PRIVATE_BATCH_2.json PRIVATE_FINALIZATION.json \
  --label-lock PRIVATE_LABEL_LOCK.json \
  --label-access-receipt PRIVATE_LABEL_ACCESS_RECEIPT.json \
  --output PRIVATE_VALIDATION_ARCHIVE.json
```

Production first needs the currently unimplemented external proof verifier. It
must consume actual inclusion/consistency proof arrays, checkpoint roots and
tree sizes—not caller-asserted digests—cover every issuance and signed exposure
gaplessly through a terminal checkpoint. Each event must be externally anchored
within 300 seconds; an exposure admitted into a sealed label-free row must also
be anchored before effort starts, while terminal-only post-effort exposure keeps
the 300-second deadline. The terminal checkpoint must cover every issuance and
exposure through `reconciled_through_at`, be anchored at or after that watermark,
and be anchored no more than 300 seconds later. Exact server-authoritative
effort-start/completion events must also be proven. A zero-event stream still
needs that independently signed and anchored zero-size checkpoint with verified
genesis consistency. The anchor provider/key is pinned in activation, distinct
from the exporter, externally allowlisted, and independently custodied.

Only after that proof succeeds may an independent pinned-runtime production
service recompute the analysis, reconcile the final removal high-water mark,
issue and atomically consume a server nonce, and publish in that same operation.
It returns a signed receipt. Supplying that receipt with `--publication-audit`
only verifies and archives it locally; the local output remains
`publishable: false` and can never authorize production publication.

All evidence, manifests, receipts, and archives must live in encrypted private
storage with 0700 directories and 0600 files. The production primary exporter
also requires a deletion-linked, server-authoritative participant token stable
across sessions and devices; the resettable reporter/device token used by the
current public secondary flow is not eligible for primary concentration gates.
The externally anchored at-impression signer/exporter and tamper-evident
issuance log are not live today, so prospective primary activation remains
blocked.

## Official-source workflow

List source stewards and official access pages:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli sources
```

Download the selected NOAA CUDEM/Coastal Relief product and its metadata from
the official viewer. Record the exact product/version, access date, published
CRS, vertical datum, and SHA-256. Reproject externally to a north-up,
metre-based local CRS if needed; do not relabel the CRS.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli ingest-bathymetry \
  --input data/raw/noaa_tile.tif \
  --output data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --source-id noaa_ncei_cudem \
  --vertical-datum 'PUBLISHED DATUM' \
  --expected-sha256 'REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SHA256'

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli derive-terrain \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --output data/processed/terrain.npz
```

For deep representation learning, derive the ten-channel structure contract.
It retains the six baseline channels and adds local relief, rugosity, and two
orientation channels. The resolution audit records which physical feature
widths are actually supportable by the native grid.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli derive-structure \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --output data/processed/structure.npz \
  --local-radius 4 \
  --broad-radius 24 \
  --relief-radius 8 \
  --horizontal-accuracy-m 2

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli audit-resolution \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --horizontal-accuracy-m 2 \
  --feature-widths-m 1 2 5 10 20 50 100
```

Aligned acoustic backscatter, seafloor-character, uncertainty, survey-age, or
optical kelp/surf layers can be appended with an explicit availability mask.
Missing coverage is therefore observable to the model rather than silently
median-filled.

Export complete-effort CRFS sample records from the official source and keep
the raw file and query parameters. Before pipeline ingestion, transform each
complete effort segment into one canonical observation v2 JSON object. Flat
catch-only CSVs and expanded estimates are rejected because they cannot supply
truthful zero-catch effort or one-row-per-attempt labels. A JSONL row has this
shape (abbreviated only by having one zero-count target row):

The separately receipted public CDFW ds3186 and ds3185 BlockBox CPUA layers are aggregate
descriptive context only. They do not satisfy this complete-effort contract and must not be
passed to `ingest-observations`. See `docs/OFFICIAL-FISHERIES-DATA.md` for their exact source
versions, checksums, missing-value sentinel, and prohibited uses.

```json
{"contract_version":"castingcompass.observation/2.0.0","taxon_catalog_version":"castingcompass.taxa/1.0.0","contract_status":"valid","observation_id":"crfs:sample-123","effort_segment_id":"crfs:effort-123","primary_target_taxon_id":"california-halibut","source":{"source_id":"cdfw_crfs","source_record_id":"sample-123","data_kind":"complete-effort-segment","complete_attempt":true,"expanded_estimate":false},"target_effort":{"value":2.5,"unit":"angler-hours","mode":"shore"},"temporal_support":{"start_at":"2026-06-01T15:00:00Z","end_at":"2026-06-01T17:30:00Z","precision":"exact"},"spatial_support":{"kind":"site","support_id":"crfs-site-123"},"taxon_observations":[{"taxon_id":"california-halibut","encounter_count":0,"retained_count":0,"released_count":0,"disposition_unknown_count":0,"identification_confidence":"not_observed","identification_basis":"not-observed"}],"outcome_class":"no_fish"}
```

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli ingest-observations \
  --input data/canonical/crfs_observations.jsonl \
  --output data/processed/observations.csv \
  --source-id cdfw_crfs \
  --primary-target-taxon-id california-halibut \
  --expected-sha256 'REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SHA256'
```

Every record must declare the same primary target. Per-taxon rows distinguish
`target_encountered`, `non_target_only`, and `no_fish`; unresolved non-target
fish remain `unresolved-fish` rather than being promoted to a named species.
Area/site rows and bounded-time rows are retained for descriptive analysis but
receive `terrain_model_eligible=false`. Only exact-time, legitimately released
point coordinates in the raster's exact projected CRS may enter patch models.
The flattened `sample_weight` is always `1.0` per complete effort segment; it
is never a survey expansion weight.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli validate \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --observations data/processed/observations.csv \
  --target-taxon-id california-halibut

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli evaluate-baselines \
  --terrain data/processed/terrain.npz \
  --observations data/processed/observations.csv \
  --output-dir artifacts/real-baseline-v1 \
  --dataset-kind real_observations \
  --target-taxon-id california-halibut \
  --splits 5 \
  --buffer-m 250
```

## Optional dependencies

- `rasterio`: read official GeoTIFFs during bathymetry ingestion.
- `pyproj`: independently verify that CRS axes are projected metres.
- `torch`: run the six-channel ResNet self-supervised/fine-tuning scaffold.

Install optional packages in an isolated environment using the platform- and
accelerator-appropriate versions. No Python environment is silently modified by
this repository.

When PyTorch is installed, this checks architecture shapes and finite losses;
it does not train or evaluate a model:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli deep-smoke
```

Build three physical views around every training center and pretrain a shared
encoder with learned scale attention. Resampling makes tensor sizes consistent
but never upgrades source resolution.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli build-pretraining-corpus \
  --feature-stack data/processed/structure.npz \
  --output data/processed/pretraining-corpus.npz \
  --radii-m 32 128 512 \
  --output-size 33 \
  --stride-m 50 \
  --max-centers 2000

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli pretrain-bathymetry \
  --corpus data/processed/pretraining-corpus.npz \
  --output-dir artifacts/bathymetry-ssl-v1 \
  --epochs 25 \
  --batch-size 32
```

`pretrain-bathymetry` holds out a complete geographic region, fits robust
normalization on training geography only, trains orientation-preserving
SimCLR views, excludes nearby overlapping terrain from the negative-pair set,
and saves the best checkpoint plus hashes, configuration, and loss history.
NT-Xent is an optimization diagnostic, not catch accuracy.

The next frozen experiment adds measured acoustic backscatter without hiding
coverage gaps. First ingest the official raster through `ingest-bathymetry`
using its real source identity and checksum, then append it to the already
derived structure stack. Alignment must match exactly; the value layer is
paired with a binary availability channel before missing cells are filled.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli append-aligned-layer \
  --feature-stack data/processed/structure.npz \
  --feature-stack-sha256 REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SHA256 \
  --layer data/processed/backscatter.npz \
  --layer-sha256 REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SHA256 \
  --layer-name backscatter_intensity_8101_2004 \
  --output data/processed/structure-backscatter.npz

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli build-pretraining-corpus \
  --feature-stack data/processed/structure-backscatter.npz \
  --output data/processed/hybrid-pretraining-corpus.npz \
  --radii-m 32 128 512 \
  --output-size 33 \
  --stride-m 64 \
  --max-centers 4096
```

Run all three modalities with the same corpus, fold, architecture, optimizer,
masking, and seed. Each run combines spatial NT-Xent with masked reconstruction;
backscatter reconstruction is scored only where its source-availability mask
is true.

```bash
for modality in bathymetry backscatter fused; do
  python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli pretrain-hybrid-seafloor \
    --corpus data/processed/hybrid-pretraining-corpus.npz \
    --output-dir "artifacts/hybrid-seafloor-${modality}-v1" \
    --modality "$modality" \
    --epochs 20 \
    --batch-size 64 \
    --validation-fold 0 \
    --split-regions 5 \
    --seed 42
done
```

These commands produce target-agnostic model-run receipts under dataset kind
`official_unlabeled_seafloor_remote_sensing`. A lower hybrid loss is not fishing
skill, habitat validation, or a promotion result. The three frozen encoders must
still face the same independent seafloor/habitat probe and a dedicated
rare-structure test.

## Reproducible USGS 2 m pilot

The first official-data pilot uses the USGS Offshore of San Francisco 2 m
multibeam bathymetry product. It verifies the public-data download, checksum,
crop, ten-channel feature, three-scale corpus, geographic holdout, training,
and checkpoint path:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv-geo-deep
.venv-geo-deep/bin/python -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --require-hashes \
  --index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
  -r pipeline/requirements-geo-deep-macos-arm64.lock
CC_OPTIONAL_STACK=macos-arm64 CC_REQUIRE_MPS=1 \
  .venv-geo-deep/bin/python pipeline/scripts/check_geo_deep_environment.py
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_2m_ssl_pilot.sh
```

That command is specifically for CPython 3.12 on macOS 15+ ARM64. Linux x86-64 CPU
uses `requirements-geo-deep-linux-cpu.lock` with PyPI plus the official PyTorch CPU
index, as exercised by `.github/workflows/optional-python.yml`. CUDA, ROCm, Windows,
and other platforms require separate reviewed locks and platform tests before use.

The pilot crop is 4.096 km square and uses 512 locations with 64 m, 256 m,
and 1,024 m diameter views. The full-area path below streams tiled GeoTIFF/COG
windows instead of materializing every derived channel in one feature stack.

The production-scale corpus path streams the complete source survey in
overlapping tiles and reproduces the recorded 4,096-location SSL v1 run:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_2m_full_pretraining.sh
```

The complete run uses five spatial regions, 20 epochs, nearby-negative
exclusion, and a wider encoder. Its checkpoint remains research-only until it
passes an independently labeled seafloor-character or habitat probe.

The follow-up hybrid experiment has a separate reproducible runner. It verifies
the bathymetry archive plus all four survey-specific backscatter archives and
GeoTIFF hashes, streams a seeded geographic reservoir across the complete
eligible footprint, reprojects masks onto the exact bathymetry grid, and runs
the locked bathymetry/backscatter/fused comparison:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python DEVICE=mps \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_hybrid_pretraining.sh
```

The published backscatter values are 8-bit relative intensity, not calibrated
dB. Overlapping survey pixels are retained as distinct value/mask channel pairs;
the runner never averages them or invents a priority mosaic.

Validation fold `3` is frozen for v1 because it is the first deterministic fold
whose training geography contains measured pixels from all four surveys. That
choice uses source availability only, before optimization, and does not consult
habitat, catch, or probe labels.

The clean-commit v1 executions and their content-equivalent pre-commit runs
matched exactly at the training-history, learned-tensor, normalization, and
corpus-binding levels. The minimized
[`hybrid-seafloor-v1` receipt](evidence/hybrid-seafloor-v1.receipt.json) records
the exact source commit, clean model identities, artifact hashes, parameter
counts, and claim boundary. The differently targeted hybrid losses are not a
representation leaderboard; use the frozen independent probes before drawing a
modality conclusion.

Run the frozen common downstream probe and the separately declared
rare-structure probe with:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python DEVICE=mps \
  HYBRID_ROOT=work/usgs-sf-hybrid-v1 \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_hybrid_probes.sh
```

The runner first rehashes the exact official pretraining corpus, all three
checkpoints, bathymetry, four survey-specific backscatter rasters, and the USGS
seafloor-character map. The common probe uses the exact pretraining holdout and
compares every frozen encoder with its architecture-matched random encoder and
input-matched classical summaries. Its row bootstrap is stratified by substrate
class.

The rare probe is intentionally separate. It samples mapped smooth and rugged
anthropogenic codes plus nearby natural controls; requires a mapped center at
least three native cells (approximately 6 m) across; holds out whole connected
components in geographic regions; excludes training rows within 512 m of test
rows; and resamples connected components rather than pixels for uncertainty.
Its balanced case-control sample cannot estimate natural prevalence or
population accuracy. Because the USGS target was interpreted using bathymetry,
backscatter, and video, neither probe is independent of all source variables or
evidence of fishing skill. Both are research-only and have no serving path.

Before using another downstream target, run the frozen post-hoc source shortcut
diagnostic:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python DEVICE=mps \
  HYBRID_ROOT=work/usgs-sf-hybrid-v1 \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_hybrid_shortcut_diagnostic.sh
```

The diagnostic first audits whether the exact pretraining holdout contains more
than one survey domain. It then tests availability-only, coordinate-only,
bathymetry, and fused features on that same held-out geography; stratifies
interior and source-seam rows; and evaluates every leave-one-survey-domain-out
split that meets the predeclared row and three-class support requirements.
Each eligible train and held-out side must contain at least 32 total rows and 16
rows per class; lower-support seam slices remain explicitly descriptive.
Overlap, missing-source, and unsupported domains are reported rather than
silently pooled. This is post-hoc shortcut evidence only: even a clean result
cannot promote an encoder or validate habitat, fishing, or live-score skill.

Audit the official raw camera observations as a candidate direct endpoint with:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  HYBRID_ROOT=work/usgs-sf-hybrid-v1 \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_video_endpoint_audit.sh
```

The runner content-addresses both video ZIPs and every archive member, parses
Point and dBASE bytes strictly, projects only classified observations with a
valid bathymetry center, and applies the same three-scale hybrid patch contract.
It enumerates whole cruise/line/tape bipartitions and requires at least 16 rows
of every collapsed class on both sides. It never permits a random split of
adjacent one-minute track observations. Passing the support gate would still
require a separately reviewed training protocol; failing it writes an exact
no-training receipt. The command has no serving or deployment path.

Audit the independently locked Santa Barbara South Coast map blocks and video cruises with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_south_coast_video_endpoint_audit.py
```

The runner downloads and hashes every official archive, extracts only manifest-declared GeoTIFFs,
and applies region-specific bathymetry/backscatter coverage from Refugio through Carpinteria. Map
overlaps use a label-blind west-to-east priority. The split unit is the entire cruise—never a line,
tape, or adjacent one-minute row—and every class needs at least 16 rows in both train and test.
The frozen audit found zero raw class-4 observations across all four cruises, so it stops without
training. This evidence boundary does not include Gaviota and has no score, serving, or deployment
path.

Screen the six residual official DS781 video archives before acquiring any additional rasters:

```bash
.venv/bin/python pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_residual_statewide_video_support_screen.py
```

The runner downloads each archive with an identifying user agent, verifies the exact ZIP and
member inventory, parses Point and DBF bytes directly, and enumerates only whole-cruise
bipartitions. The frozen execution found 444 nonblank class-`0` rows and 26 nonblank rows without
complete `LINE`/`TAPE` identity in `s2210mb`, so the source schema fails closed. Recognized-row
support is reported only as a non-authoritative diagnostic: without the invalid archive, class 4
occurs in one cruise and cannot be distributed across train and test. The command never downloads
rasters, trains a model, or changes a score, serving path, provider, or deployment.

Screen the preregistered direct sediment-composition endpoint with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_ds182_sediment_endpoint_support_audit.py
```

The runner content-addresses the complete official USGS Data Series 182 EXT archive and source
table, verifies the companion text/dBASE/Point record counts, and checks only the exact reference
raster metadata. Under v1, `PAC_EXT.txt` fails before outcome aggregation because 14,950 of 16,485
rows have 31 fields under its 32-field header. The command does not pad the missing field, switch
to dBASE, read raster pixels, build patches, train, promote, score, serve, or deploy.

Run the strict substrate-component probe with:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_2m_seafloor_probe.sh
```

The probe compares the frozen pretrained encoder with an identical random
encoder, classical ten-channel summaries, and depth-only summaries. It removes
the source raster's composite depth/slope digits and uses the same region that
was held out during self-supervised pretraining.
