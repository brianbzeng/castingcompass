# CastingCompass geospatial ML pipeline

This directory contains a reproducible, leakage-aware foundation for learning
seafloor representations and, once suitable labels exist, modeling
recreational-fishing occurrence and positive-catch CPUE. Downloaded government
rasters and model checkpoints are intentionally ignored by Git. No catch-skill
claim is made from self-supervised bathymetry training.

## Lightweight smoke test

The smoke path uses only NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. It creates a fictional
UTM raster and fictional catch records, then exercises terrain derivation,
patch extraction, spatially blocked folds, three baselines, four ablations, and
versioned run metadata.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli smoke \
  --output-dir /tmp/contourcast-smoke \
  --seed 42

python3 -m unittest discover -s pipeline/tests -v
```

Any numbers under the smoke output are synthetic plumbing-test results, not
habitat, fishing, or model-quality claims.

## Official-source workflow

List source stewards and official access pages:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli sources
```

Download the selected NOAA CUDEM/Coastal Relief product and its metadata from
the official viewer. Record the exact product/version, access date, published
CRS, vertical datum, and SHA-256. Reproject externally to a north-up,
metre-based local CRS if needed; do not relabel the CRS.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli ingest-bathymetry \
  --input data/raw/noaa_tile.tif \
  --output data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --source-id noaa_ncei_cudem \
  --vertical-datum 'PUBLISHED DATUM' \
  --expected-sha256 'REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SHA256'

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli derive-terrain \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --output data/processed/terrain.npz
```

For deep representation learning, derive the ten-channel structure contract.
It retains the six baseline channels and adds local relief, rugosity, and two
orientation channels. The resolution audit records which physical feature
widths are actually supportable by the native grid.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli derive-structure \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --output data/processed/structure.npz \
  --local-radius 4 \
  --broad-radius 24 \
  --relief-radius 8 \
  --horizontal-accuracy-m 2

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli audit-resolution \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --horizontal-accuracy-m 2 \
  --feature-widths-m 1 2 5 10 20 50 100
```

Aligned acoustic backscatter, seafloor-character, uncertainty, survey-age, or
optical kelp/surf layers can be appended with an explicit availability mask.
Missing coverage is therefore observable to the model rather than silently
median-filled.

Export complete-effort CRFS sample records from the official source and keep
the raw file and query parameters. Before pipeline ingestion, transform each
complete effort segment into one canonical observation v2 JSON object. Flat
catch-only CSVs and expanded estimates are rejected because they cannot supply
truthful zero-catch effort or one-row-per-attempt labels. A JSONL row has this
shape (abbreviated only by having one zero-count target row):

```json
{"contract_version":"castingcompass.observation/2.0.0","taxon_catalog_version":"castingcompass.taxa/1.0.0","contract_status":"valid","observation_id":"crfs:sample-123","effort_segment_id":"crfs:effort-123","primary_target_taxon_id":"california-halibut","source":{"source_id":"cdfw_crfs","source_record_id":"sample-123","data_kind":"complete-effort-segment","complete_attempt":true,"expanded_estimate":false},"target_effort":{"value":2.5,"unit":"angler-hours","mode":"shore"},"temporal_support":{"start_at":"2026-06-01T15:00:00Z","end_at":"2026-06-01T17:30:00Z","precision":"exact"},"spatial_support":{"kind":"site","support_id":"crfs-site-123"},"taxon_observations":[{"taxon_id":"california-halibut","encounter_count":0,"retained_count":0,"released_count":0,"disposition_unknown_count":0,"identification_confidence":"not_observed","identification_basis":"not-observed"}],"outcome_class":"no_fish"}
```

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli ingest-observations \
  --input data/canonical/crfs_observations.jsonl \
  --output data/processed/observations.csv \
  --source-id cdfw_crfs \
  --primary-target-taxon-id california-halibut \
  --expected-sha256 'REPLACE_WITH_REAL_SHA256'
```

Every record must declare the same primary target. Per-taxon rows distinguish
`target_encountered`, `non_target_only`, and `no_fish`; unresolved non-target
fish remain `unresolved-fish` rather than being promoted to a named species.
Area/site rows and bounded-time rows are retained for descriptive analysis but
receive `terrain_model_eligible=false`. Only exact-time, legitimately released
point coordinates in the raster's exact projected CRS may enter patch models.
The flattened `sample_weight` is always `1.0` per complete effort segment; it
is never a survey expansion weight.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli validate \
  --bathymetry data/processed/bathymetry.npz \
  --observations data/processed/observations.csv \
  --target-taxon-id california-halibut

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli evaluate-baselines \
  --terrain data/processed/terrain.npz \
  --observations data/processed/observations.csv \
  --output-dir artifacts/real-baseline-v1 \
  --dataset-kind real_observations \
  --target-taxon-id california-halibut \
  --splits 5 \
  --buffer-m 250
```

## Optional dependencies

- `rasterio`: read official GeoTIFFs during bathymetry ingestion.
- `pyproj`: independently verify that CRS axes are projected metres.
- `torch`: run the six-channel ResNet self-supervised/fine-tuning scaffold.

Install optional packages in an isolated environment using the platform- and
accelerator-appropriate versions. No Python environment is silently modified by
this repository.

When PyTorch is installed, this checks architecture shapes and finite losses;
it does not train or evaluate a model:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli deep-smoke
```

Build three physical views around every training center and pretrain a shared
encoder with learned scale attention. Resampling makes tensor sizes consistent
but never upgrades source resolution.

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli build-pretraining-corpus \
  --feature-stack data/processed/structure.npz \
  --output data/processed/pretraining-corpus.npz \
  --radii-m 32 128 512 \
  --output-size 33 \
  --stride-m 50 \
  --max-centers 2000

python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli pretrain-bathymetry \
  --corpus data/processed/pretraining-corpus.npz \
  --output-dir artifacts/bathymetry-ssl-v1 \
  --epochs 25 \
  --batch-size 32
```

`pretrain-bathymetry` holds out a complete geographic region, fits robust
normalization on training geography only, trains orientation-preserving
SimCLR views, excludes nearby overlapping terrain from the negative-pair set,
and saves the best checkpoint plus hashes, configuration, and loss history.
NT-Xent is an optimization diagnostic, not catch accuracy.

## Reproducible USGS 2 m pilot

The first official-data pilot uses the USGS Offshore of San Francisco 2 m
multibeam bathymetry product. It verifies the public-data download, checksum,
crop, ten-channel feature, three-scale corpus, geographic holdout, training,
and checkpoint path:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv-geo-deep
.venv-geo-deep/bin/pip install -r pipeline/requirements-geo-deep.txt
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_2m_ssl_pilot.sh
```

The pilot crop is 4.096 km square and uses 512 locations with 64 m, 256 m,
and 1,024 m diameter views. The full-area path below streams tiled GeoTIFF/COG
windows instead of materializing every derived channel in one feature stack.

The production-scale corpus path streams the complete source survey in
overlapping tiles and reproduces the recorded 4,096-location SSL v1 run:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_2m_full_pretraining.sh
```

The complete run uses five spatial regions, 20 epochs, nearby-negative
exclusion, and a wider encoder. Its checkpoint remains research-only until it
passes an independently labeled seafloor-character or habitat probe.

Run the strict substrate-component probe with:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN=.venv-geo-deep/bin/python \
  pipeline/scripts/run_usgs_sf_2m_seafloor_probe.sh
```

The probe compares the frozen pretrained encoder with an identical random
encoder, classical ten-channel summaries, and depth-only summaries. It removes
the source raster's composite depth/slope digits and uses the same region that
was held out during self-supervised pretraining.
