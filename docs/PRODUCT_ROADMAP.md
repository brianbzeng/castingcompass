# CastingCompass product roadmap

This list is ordered by user harm and launch risk first, followed by measurement,
validation, expansion, business readiness, and visual polish. An item is complete only
after its acceptance checks pass in the intended environment.

## P0 — Immediate safety and launch integrity

- [x] Complete the cross-functional baseline audit and establish model-truthfulness rules.
- [ ] Prevent AI-generated trip summaries from publishing without explicit human approval.
  Done when the production endpoint defaults off, AI can write only a private draft,
  legacy rows are quarantined, human approval is auditable, copy is truthful, and live
  smoke tests pass.
- [ ] Release production hardening from a clean `origin/main` worktree: central security
  headers, health/security endpoints, edge abuse controls, sanitized logs, staged migration
  tests, monitoring, alerts, backup verification, and a restore drill.
- [ ] Make account privacy promises durable: deletion queue/tombstones for photos and public
  copies, truthful completion semantics, and an age-only first step before email/password.

## P1 — Evidence, data contracts, discoverability, and scalable foundations

- [ ] Freeze the species-aware observation and model-run contract before new ingestion or
  recruitment: canonical/versioned taxa or explicit complexes; one primary target per
  evaluable effort segment; structured per-taxon encounters, retained/released counts, and
  identification confidence; distinct target-no-encounter versus no-fish outcomes; and a
  loader that rejects mixed/unexpected taxa and records the target in every artifact.
- [ ] Freeze the validation protocol before collecting more outcomes: complete targeted
  trips including skunks, effort and mode, immutable source-separated splits, geographic and
  temporal holdouts, preregistered baselines, outcome-independent incentives, preserved
  model version and `scoreInfluencedChoice`, and independent or safely randomized trip
  selection where possible. Curated site IDs support site × time-window claims only; precise
  casting-zone research requires separate consent, minimization, access, retention/deletion,
  and sensitive-location controls.
- [ ] Acquire reproducible official CDFW/CRFS/RecFIN data—starting with CDFW ds3186
  all-species/all-effort and ds3185 rockfish/cabezon blocks—and start a prospective first-party
  cohort. Every snapshot needs its query/export manifest, retrieval date, checksum, license,
  attribution, dictionary, source version, sampling design, denominator, and spatial/time
  support. Keep samples separate from expanded estimates, never invent point labels from
  blocks, and declare training/validation/context permissions per source.
- [ ] Treat Fishbrain as an optional written-license partnership and Facebook groups as
  admin-approved prospective recruitment—not scraped retrospective evidence. Licensed social
  data without complete attempts, no-catch, effort, coverage, and sampling propensity is for
  discovery, weak supervision, or external trend corroboration only; the independent benchmark
  remains a source-separated prospective cohort.
- [ ] Validate the California halibut relative ranking against frozen baselines before broader
  claims; publish uncertainty, limitations, negative results, and the current all-zero sample
  constraint. Attempt probability calibration only after a trained occurrence model has a
  sufficiently representative held-out set of positive and negative outcomes.
- [ ] Define model promotion, drift, and rollback gates: beat preregistered geographic/time
  holdout baselines before promotion; monitor by site, season, mode, and taxon; version every
  release; and require rollback/revalidation when performance or data support drifts.
- [ ] Establish truthful technical SEO and measurement without promoting unvalidated accuracy:
  Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools verification, sitemap submission, crawl/index
  coverage, canonical URLs, metadata, social previews, appropriate structured data, Core Web
  Vitals, mobile/accessibility checks, and privacy-conscious conversion analytics.
- [ ] Make infrastructure mobile-ready and scalable with versioned APIs/shared schemas,
  appropriate mobile authentication, queue-based AI work, staging, bounded retries/costs,
  and WebKit/offline/safe-area coverage.

## P2 — Species and business expansion

- [ ] Add striped bass as the first new beta using a distinct estuary/migration model.
- [ ] Define and evaluate explicit shore-relevant rockfish species/complexes next; then model
  cabezon as its own taxon; then split surfperch into defensible habitat/taxon groups. Each beta
  needs its own source inventory, model card, validation gate, and current regulation treatment.
- [ ] Complete business/legal readiness before substantial promotion or revenue: entity/DBA,
  tax and local-license review, trademark clearance, startup counsel/CPA review, DMCA/UGC
  posture, and broker quotes for cyber/privacy, technology E&O, general, and media liability.

## P3 — Experience and brand

- [ ] Improve accessibility and interaction quality after core risks are controlled, including
  keyboard/screen-reader review, zoom/reflow, contrast, reduced motion, and a non-map path.
- [ ] Refresh visual design, graphics, species art, empty states, social cards, and brand
  illustration. Artist collaboration is intentionally deferred and can focus on expressive
  assets while product interaction remains usability-led.
