# CastingCompass dataset card

**Status:** species-aware contract assets, multiscale structure pipeline, and
exactly reproduced official bathymetry/backscatter/fused self-supervised
pretraining implemented. The production species migration, independent
representation probes, and any supervised catch-training dataset remain
unapproved. Official rasters and weights are not bundled.

**Version:** 0.4.0

## Intended dataset

CastingCompass is designed to join a bathymetric terrain grid with recreational
fishing observations for Bay and coastal California research. The intended
learning unit is one complete, targeted effort segment. It declares exactly one
primary target, target-specific effort, temporal and spatial support, and
structured observations for every encountered taxon. Aggregated survey
estimates remain separate and must not be treated as effort segments or
exact-point labels.

This dataset is for exploratory habitat and product research. It is not a
nautical chart, navigation aid, regulatory source, biological stock assessment,
or guarantee that fish will be present.

CRFS and RecFIN are not NOAA bathymetry products. Their actual stewards are
preserved because survey ownership, design documentation, and citation matter.
CDFW states that CRFS data and estimates from 2004 onward are available through
RecFIN. Raw query exports, query filters, access dates, and checksums must be
retained.

The exact ds3185/ds3186 source revisions, dictionaries, sampling boundaries, permissions, and
canonical snapshot receipts are documented in [OFFICIAL-FISHERIES-DATA.md](OFFICIAL-FISHERIES-DATA.md).
They are aggregate descriptive context only. They cannot enter observation-v2 training,
validation, calibration, production scoring, or exact-point terrain labels.

## Data contracts

### Bathymetry

The canonical NPZ contains:

- `values`: one 2-D, positive-upward elevation raster in metres;
- `metadata.crs`: a projected CRS with metre axes;
- `metadata.transform`: six-coefficient, north-up GDAL affine transform;
- `metadata.vertical_datum`: the datum published with the selected product;
- `metadata.source_id`, nodata value, units, and schema version.

Geographic degrees, rotated grids, unknown vertical datums, empty rasters, and
non-metre horizontal units are rejected. `pyproj`, when installed, performs an
independent CRS semantics check. Without it, the provenance record explicitly
marks CRS semantics as unverified.

Elevation products from different vertical datums must not be stacked or
compared until a documented vertical transformation is performed. Resolution
is not treated as positional or vertical accuracy. NOAA elevation products are
explicitly **not for navigation**.

### Fishing observations

The language-neutral source of truth is:

- `contracts/taxa.json` and `contracts/taxa.schema.json` at
  `castingcompass.taxa/1.0.0`;
- `contracts/observation.schema.json` at
  `castingcompass.observation/2.0.0`;
- `shared/species-contract.ts` and `shared/species_contract.py` for matching
  identity and catalog-eligibility helpers. TypeScript provides the reusable
  semantic record validators; Python enforces the same observation semantics
  at ingestion and again in the model loader.

The JSON schemas are strict structural envelopes, not substitutes for semantic
validation. Cross-field rules such as unique taxon IDs, count reconciliation,
confidence/basis compatibility, temporal ordering, environment eligibility,
and derived outcomes are exercised from one shared adversarial fixture corpus
through both the TypeScript validator and the actual Python ingestion path.

The closed launch catalog contains `california-halibut` as the only production
model target, `unresolved-fish` as an observation-only bucket, and
`synthetic-target` for tests only. `rockfish`, `unknown`, and other generic terms
are not production targets. A future rockfish release must add defensible named
species or an explicitly reviewed complex in a new catalog version.

Every v2 record includes:

- `contract_version`, `taxon_catalog_version`, stable observation and effort
  segment IDs, and `contract_status: valid`;
- one `primary_target_taxon_id` and positive `target_effort` with its unit and
  fishing mode;
- source assertions that the row is a complete attempt and not an expanded
  estimate;
- bounded or exact temporal support and honest point, site, or area spatial
  support;
- one unique `taxon_observations` entry per represented taxon, with encounter,
  retained, released, and disposition-unknown counts that reconcile exactly;
- an identification confidence and basis. Current unreviewed first-party named
  catches are `self_reported` / `angler-report`, not verified. Unidentified fish
  remain `unresolved-fish` / `unresolved`; and
- one derived `outcome_class`: `target_encountered`, `non_target_only`, or
  `no_fish`. Even `no_fish` records contain the primary-target row with zero
  counts and `not_observed` / `not-observed` identity.

The loader fails closed on missing or unknown versions, multiple or mismatched
targets, unknown taxa, generic production targets, duplicate taxon rows,
inconsistent counts or outcomes, catch-only inputs, expanded estimates,
synthetic data in production, or a false confidence/basis pairing. Canonical
site and area records can support descriptive analysis. Launch-v2 point records
must use one of the explicitly approved projected CRSs. Only an exact-time point
record whose CRS also exactly matches the expected model grid can become a
terrain-model row.

The importer never converts an area centroid, port, district, or survey stratum
into a purported catch location. An area-only record may support aggregate
descriptive analysis. A future weakly supervised experiment may represent the
entire released area as a bag of terrain patches and supervise only the bag;
attention on individual patches is not ground-truthed hotspot evidence.

Sample data and expanded survey estimates have different meanings. Expansion
weights, strata, modes, uncertainty fields, and source documentation must be
retained in the raw layer. The v2 flattened modeling table sets `sample_weight`
to `1.0` because each row is one complete effort segment; that value is not a
survey expansion or reliability weight. Expanded estimates are rejected until
a separate survey-weighted estimator is explicitly implemented and validated.

### Legacy migration and eligibility

The additive species migration records the observation/catalog versions,
target taxon, structured taxon observations, outcome class, target/all-fish
counts, and target-identification confidence. Historical trip rows did not
collect the full v2 evidence. They are backfilled as `legacy_unverified`, remain
available for account history and deletion, and are excluded from training,
validation, and calibration. A `rejected` status records failed contract intake;
neither status is a valid v2 observation payload. Production migration and
aggregate post-migration audits must complete before collection is described as
contract-v2 live.

## Derived terrain and structure channels

All six channels are aligned to the bathymetry raster in this fixed order:

1. `depth_m`: positive-down depth, `max(-elevation, 0)`;
2. `slope_deg`: gradient magnitude converted to degrees;
3. `roughness_m`: local depth standard deviation;
4. `curvature`: horizontal Laplacian of elevation;
5. `tpi_local_m`: depth minus local-window mean;
6. `tpi_broad_m`: depth minus broad-window mean.

Defaults use radii of two and six cells. Pixel size, radii, sign convention,
channel names, source datum, and robust summary statistics are saved with each
artifact. Nodata pixels stay invalid after derivation; finite fill is used only
internally to avoid derivative explosions at holes.

The deep-learning structure stack adds:

7. `local_relief_m`: local maximum minus minimum depth;
8. `rugosity_ratio`: local surface-area proxy, equal to one on a flat cell;
9. `aspect_sin`: north/south grid-axis component of the elevation gradient;
10. `aspect_cos`: east/west grid-axis component of the elevation gradient.

Orientation is preserved by default during augmentation because alignment with
shore, current, surf, and other linear structures may be predictive. Optional
backscatter, substrate/seafloor character, survey uncertainty, survey age,
kelp-canopy, or surf-break layers must align exactly to the reference grid.
Every auxiliary value layer receives a paired availability mask before missing
values are filled.

The first frozen hybrid experiment uses the four official 2 m USGS Offshore of
San Francisco backscatter survey rasters (`8101_2004`, `8101_2007`,
`8101_2008`, and `7125_2006`) listed by the source catalog. They are distinct
survey footprints, not interchangeable repeated observations. Acquisition must
retain every source ZIP and metadata file, record byte hashes, mosaic only onto
the matching 2 m bathymetry reference grid, and leave all uncovered cells
explicitly unavailable. The resulting corpus kind is
`official_unlabeled_seafloor_remote_sensing`; it is target-agnostic and cannot
be interpreted as catch or habitat labels.

## Physical resolution contract

CastingCompass separates pixel spacing from reliable feature detection:

- fewer than two native cells across: `unresolved`;
- two to fewer than three cells: `marginal`;
- three or more cells, subject to published positional accuracy: `resolvable`.

At 2 m/pixel, the conservative structure threshold is therefore about 6 m. A
narrow pipe may not be directly resolved. A wider raised corridor, scour,
bedform disruption, acoustic-backscatter response, kelp footprint, or habitat
edge can still be represented when it spans enough native cells. Upsampling a
coarse raster never improves this classification.

Each location is represented at multiple physical scales. The initial pilot
uses 64 m, 256 m, and 1,024 m diameter views, corresponding to immediate
structure, surrounding habitat, and broad geomorphic context.

## Spatial alignment and leakage controls

- Raster channels must match CRS, shape, affine transform, and units exactly.
- Observations must use the same projected CRS and lie within raster bounds.
- Terrain patches are extracted only after these checks.
- Evaluation creates spatially contiguous K-means regions and holds out each
  complete region once.
- An optional metre buffer removes training observations close to held-out
  points. Preprocessing and model fitting occur inside each fold.
- Random row splits are not accepted as evidence of spatial generalization.

The K-means regions are an evaluation scaffold, not a claim that they correspond
to ecological management areas. Before a reported experiment, region count and
buffer distance should be chosen from sampling density and the intended product
use, then fixed before inspecting test results.

That scaffold applies to exact-point terrain experiments. First-party
CastingCompass trips deliberately retain curated `site` support and cannot
enter the point loader. Historical v1 preserves a fixed site-catalog SHA-256 in
`validation/catalogs/california-halibut-bay-area-v1.json`, with 46 sites assigned
once to five named panels and four absolute time blocks, but
it is not activatable. The v2 successor uses the same curated site support only
for a collection-feasibility pilot. Neither design invents a site centroid,
weakens point-model eligibility, or treats a whole trip spanning multiple
windows as a point label. Pre-freeze, pre-activation, past, and legacy rows
remain product-observational only regardless of structural validity.

The public site catalog may expand independently of that archive. Its Santa
Barbara South Coast entries are product-planning locations with curated habitat
priors and public forecast sources, not labeled training data and not eligible
pilot geography. Local trip reports remain model-excluded unless a future
prospective protocol freezes the expanded population before enrollment.

Prospective rows additionally retain the frozen recruitment-frame ID, one of
three allowed pre-outcome source IDs, recruitment event time/hash, and—only for
admin-approved community recruitment—the prior approval hash. The validation
analysis is a census of every eligible accepted row in the fixed interval; it
cannot take a post-hoc or arrival-ordered subsample. Recruitment-source and
selection-design mix are preserved for required stratified reporting.

## Known biases and limitations

- CRFS/RecFIN measure fishing activity and observed catches, not complete fish
  presence/absence. Angler choices, access, regulations, gear, skill, season,
  weather, and survey coverage shape the labels.
- A zero catch is not a confirmed biological absence.
- Popular or accessible areas and commonly retained species can be
  overrepresented.
- Bathymetry surveys have heterogeneous age, density, and uncertainty.
- Public survey geography may be much coarser than a DEM pixel.
- CPUE values can be heavy-tailed and are not automatically comparable across
  modes or survey designs.
- Sensitive user-contributed fishing locations require access controls,
  coordinate minimization, and an explicit retention/deletion policy before
  collection. No private user data is included here.

## Reproducibility and versioning

Every real-data run must preserve:

- immutable raw files and SHA-256 hashes;
- exact source product/query, filters, access date, citation, and manifest ID;
- CRS and vertical-datum transformation history;
- terrain configuration and fixed channel order;
- observation eligibility counts and rejected-row reasons;
- geographic split seed/count/buffer;
- for the v2 feasibility pilot, the externally registered protocol hash,
  activation identity, immutable release/Worker/scoring identity, recruitment
  source/event identity, site-catalog hash, exact interval, started-attempt
  reconciliation, and encrypted snapshot checksum;
- for a later confirmatory study, its separate preregistration, activation,
  outcome-blind split identity, fixed candidate/baselines, and locked input
  hashes required by that future protocol;
- Git revision, Python runtime, input hashes, experiment version, model version,
  target scope, catalog version, and observation contract version from
  `run_metadata.json`.

Run the synthetic plumbing check with:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.contourcast.cli smoke --output-dir /tmp/contourcast-smoke
```

Synthetic fixture metrics are labeled `synthetic_fixture` and are not real-data
results.

No study export may contain raw email, account ID, resettable reporter hash,
notes, photos, IP address, user agent, or exact coordinates. V2 uses a privacy-
safe deletion-linked participant group, append-only corrections, and daily
encrypted checksummed snapshots. Deletion and withdrawal must be reconciled
before a feasibility report. Candidate performance is not evaluated on v2.

## Current results

The full official USGS 2 m survey has passed windowed ingestion, resolution
audit, ten-channel derivation, three-scale corpus creation, geographic
validation, and exactly reproduced self-supervised checkpoint training across
4,096 sampled locations. This is unlabeled representation learning only. No
class balance, catch metric, habitat conclusion, or Opportunity Score accuracy
improvement is claimed.

The first frozen-embedding probe joins 4,095 corpus locations to the USGS 2 m
seafloor-character map after an explicit EPSG:26910-to-EPSG:32610 coordinate
transformation. Composite depth/slope digits are removed from the target. The
map was itself derived from bathymetry, acoustic backscatter, and
interpreter/video evidence, so the result measures transferable character
signal rather than an independent biological endpoint.
