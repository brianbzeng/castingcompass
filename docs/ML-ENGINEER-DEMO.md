# ML-engineer demo checkpoint

**Status:** verified local candidate; not a production-release receipt

This demo combines the reviewed Santa Barbara South Coast planning expansion with
the first fail-closed water-quality advisory slice. It is suitable for a local
technical walkthrough. It is not authorization to merge, deploy, activate a
provider, collect validation evidence, or claim model performance.

## Start the local candidate

Use the reviewed Node `22.23.1` and npm `10.9.8` toolchain. From the candidate
checkout:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build:cloudflare
npm run start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:4173>. Docker, Cloudflare access, production credentials,
remote databases, and provider mutations are not needed for this walkthrough.
Keep the demo on localhost. Do not use account, deployment, or production-admin
flows as part of the presentation.

## Ten-minute walkthrough

1. Select **Goleta** or **Santa Barbara** and switch between list and map views.
   Explain that the catalog now spans 14 conservative public-access locations
   from Gaviota through Rincon, with protected or ambiguous water omitted.
2. Open a location report. Show the relative Opportunity Score, its transparent
   habitat/seasonality/conditions/fishability components, access caveats, casting
   zone, and structure guidance. The score ranks the currently evaluated windows;
   it is not a catch probability.
3. Open **Forecast check** and show source identity and freshness. Missing or stale
   inputs remain missing or stale instead of receiving invented replacements.
4. Open `/?site=crissy-field-east-beach` to demonstrate the stable site-link and
   neutral water-contact context. The checked-in advisory artifact is a
   deterministic review snapshot, not a live provider query. It never improves
   the fishing score or claims that contact or seafood is safe.
5. Point out that an active exact agency status removes a mapped site from the
   recommendation list without rewriting its attested fishing score. Unmapped,
   stale, unavailable, or unmonitored sites remain explicitly unknown.
6. Show the trip-log language only as a product workflow. Friend and community
   reports remain private ordinary observations; none automatically trains,
   validates, or changes the model.

## Accurate technical framing

- The shipped ranking is an explainable heuristic configuration over curated
  habitat priors, provisional seasonality, public forecast conditions,
  fishability, and a small access-pressure modifier.
- The repository contains a research pipeline with geographically blocked
  evaluation, baselines, ablations, a six-channel encoder, and synthetic smoke
  coverage. No trained deep model contributes to the public ranking today.
- The original 47-site Bay Area validation population remains frozen. Adding
  Santa Barbara product coverage cannot rewrite earlier validation semantics.
- Current public performance evidence is all-zero/inconclusive. Do not describe
  the product as validated, accurate, calibrated, predictive, or safer than an
  alternative.

## Verified local receipt

The combined working tree passed the Cloudflare build, 472 Node tests, 144 mobile
Chromium/WebKit cases, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete security and source-
integrity chain, zero-vulnerability full and production npm audits, 29 API tests,
83 pipeline tests (one documented optional-`rasterio` skip), Ruff, the synthetic
pipeline smoke, and all 19 critical D1 query-plan checks. An exact integration
commit and hosted checks are still required before this section can name a final
review head.

## Deliberately unfinished

- Local-anglers' access review for all 14 regional sites, including two reviews
  for each limited-access site.
- Official water-quality mappings for Santa Barbara/Goleta and the rest of the
  launch catalog; any numeric pollution or fishing-quality contribution.
- Location-by-location official/licensed structure and depth inventories.
- Prospective regional model validation, independent product/safety review,
  provider evidence, guarded deployment, and post-deployment verification.

If asked whether it is ready for production, the accurate answer is: **the local
demo candidate is verified, but production release remains intentionally closed.**
