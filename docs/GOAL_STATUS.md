# CastingCompass goal status

Last reconciled: **2026-07-21 UTC**

This is the owner-facing dashboard for the complete goal list. The detailed acceptance
criteria and immutable receipts remain in [PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md); provider
steps remain in [PRODUCTION-OPERATIONS.md](PRODUCTION-OPERATIONS.md). A checked item here means
its complete acceptance boundary passed. “Local complete” means the repository control passed
but the parent stays open until its production, provider, legal, or independent-review gate is
also satisfied.

Current provider truth overrides historical “paused” language in completed receipts below. The
2026-07-19 read-only reconciliation found an active Worker; no production mutation is authorized
by that discovery.

## Active checkpoint — San Francisco water-quality coverage negative evidence

- [x] Preserve draft PR `#138` at exact receipt head
      `19bb941c53b9ed1b2af04886f8c96e062922ec85` as the stacked base. This
      follow-up is isolated from the dirty primary checkout and does not merge, deploy, mutate
      Cloudflare or D1, change the catalog or score, or reinterpret current official status.
- [x] Audit the fixed SFPUC machine endpoint read-only for the four still-unmapped San Francisco
      sites. The `2026-07-21T13:03:50Z` capture returned 20 official station records and is bound
      by response, audit-tool, and catalog SHA-256 digests. The receipt contains only public
      station metadata and bounded nearest-candidate distances.
- [x] Preserve the negative result instead of inferring coverage from proximity. The closest
      official points to Torpedo Wharf, Pier 7, Pier 14, and Heron's Head Park Pier are 792 m,
      2,439 m, 2,520 m, and 1,508 m away and have different official location identities. All
      four remain `not-covered`, `unknown`, and null-score rather than inheriting another
      waterfront's sample status.
- [x] Add a deterministic audit tool and regression tests that validate coordinates and source
      structure, bind the source response, expose four candidates for manual review, forbid
      automatic mapping, and prove the checked-in policy and advisory artifact remain fail-closed.
- [x] Complete the local verification boundary under pinned Node `22.23.1` and the locked Python
      environments: a fresh zero-script install, both zero-vulnerability npm audits, Cloudflare
      build, 490/490 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete offline security/SBOM/source-
      integrity chain, Ruff and Python syntax, 29/29 API tests, 83/83 pipeline tests with one
      documented optional-`rasterio` skip, deterministic synthetic smoke, and all 19 critical D1
      query plans passed. No application UI or runtime behavior changed, so the preceding exact
      base's 188-case mobile receipt remains the relevant visual boundary pending hosted CI.
- [x] Publish protected stacked draft PR `#139` without merge or deployment. Exact implementation
      head `8fa57c5c5a08d663ce9371428e25970f3bd46f41` passed push and pull-request CI runs
      `29832866054` and `29832885780`, including two independent 188/188 Chromium/WebKit phone
      matrices; release-provenance runs `29832866449` and `29832885652`; native API-image run
      `29833491767` on Linux AMD64 and ARM64; and explicitly dispatched optional research-stack
      run `29833494290` on Linux CPU and macOS ARM64. Event-inapplicable dependency and release-
      attestation jobs skipped as designed.
- [ ] Obtain independent spatial-support review or a more exact official source before mapping any
      of these four sites. Broader launch-catalog coverage, numeric-contribution validation,
      CodeQL on protected `main`, merge, deployment, provider/database mutation, and production
      activation remain separate open gates.

## Active checkpoint — Oakland through South Bay source-bound chart context

- [x] Preserve draft PR `#137` at exact final receipt head
      `488f8f78b4b292db88fd83800e9df4a46a9fc384` as the reviewed stacked base. This
      final catalog-extension work uses another isolated worktree and does not merge, deploy,
      mutate Cloudflare or D1, change a catalog prior, or alter the attested fishing score.
- [x] Select the final coherent ten-site launch-catalog cohort: Port View Park Fishing Pier,
      Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, Alameda South Shore Rock Wall, Crown Memorial State Beach,
      Oyster Bay Regional Shoreline, San Leandro Marina Shore, Dumbarton Fishing Pier, Coyote
      Point Jetty, Seal Point Park Shoreline, and Oyster Point Fishing Pier. The same NOAA ENC
      Direct `Approach` source, 13-layer inventory, meters/MLLW meaning, bounded geometry, and
      fail-closed drift rules apply.
- [x] Capture and normalize a fixed `2026-07-21T12:10:36Z` source snapshot for all 61 covered
      sites using 854 bounded layer queries. All ten new configured sectors intersect one or more
      depth-area bands and have nearby deduplicated soundings. The prior 51 site records and
      reviewed service metadata are unchanged; old, month-precision, and undated source records
      remain explicit.
- [x] Extend the strict artifact/schema/type contract to version 1.5 and add deterministic cohort,
      partial-date, score-exclusion, navigation-exclusion, and mobile truthfulness coverage. All
      ten locations retain `scoreDelta: null`; chart context cannot authorize access or imply
      shore-reachable depth, castability, wading safety, or navigation use.
- [x] Complete the fresh full local release matrix under pinned Node `22.23.1` and the
      hash-locked Python environments: fresh zero-script installation, both zero-vulnerability
      npm audits, Cloudflare build, 487/487 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete
      security/SBOM/source-integrity chain, 12 deterministic/adversarial structure-depth tests,
      Python syntax/Ruff, 29/29 API tests, 83/83 pipeline tests with one documented optional-
      `rasterio` skip, deterministic synthetic smoke, and all 19 critical D1 query plans passed.
      The complete CI-profile Chromium/WebKit phone matrix passed 188/188 cases. Port View depth
      and date evidence plus Coyote Point display-only evidence were visually inspected from the
      production build at iPhone width.
- [x] Publish protected stacked draft PR `#138` without merge or deployment. Exact implementation
      head `79a356817322072ffe0dba22a0db5bce9f150504` passed push and pull-request CI runs
      `29830471008` and `29830496758`; release-provenance runs `29830470999` and `29830496817`;
      native API-image run `29830496822` on Linux AMD64 and ARM64; and explicitly dispatched
      optional research-stack run `29830504513` on Linux CPU and macOS ARM64. Hosted proof
      includes 487/487 Node tests, a 188/188 Chromium/WebKit mobile matrix, both zero-vulnerability
      audits, the secret/source-integrity/security chain, API and pipeline checks, and all 19
      critical D1 query plans. Event-inapplicable dependency and release-attestation jobs skipped
      as designed.
- [ ] Obtain CodeQL evidence when this stack is eventually reviewed against protected `main`;
      default setup did not trigger on the non-default stacked base. Independent location/chart
      review, merge, deployment, provider/database mutation, and production activation remain
      separate open gates.

## Active checkpoint — North and East Bay source-bound chart context

- [x] Preserve draft PR `#136` at exact final receipt head
      `d5c25d747e7b4a65915632ca78e3bfd5eecb366b` as the reviewed stacked base. This
      follow-up uses another isolated worktree and does not merge, deploy, mutate Cloudflare or
      D1, change a catalog prior, or alter the attested fishing score.
- [x] Select the coherent ten-site North/East Bay cohort: McNears Beach Pier, Paradise Beach Pier,
      Fort Baker Fishing Pier, Ferry Point Fishing Pier, Keller Beach, Point Isabel Shoreline,
      Albany Bulb Shoreline, Berkeley Marina North Basin Shore, Cesar Chavez Park Shoreline, and
      Emeryville Marina Fishing Pier. The same NOAA ENC Direct `Approach` source, 13-layer
      inventory, meters/MLLW meaning, bounded geometry, and fail-closed drift rules apply.
- [x] Capture and normalize a fixed `2026-07-21T11:15:36Z` source snapshot for all 51 covered
      sites using 714 bounded layer queries. Eight new sectors have one or more depth-area bands.
      McNears and Ferry Point remain explicitly `partial`: both have nearby soundings and charted
      shoreline-construction records, but no reviewed depth-area band intersects the configured
      offshore sector. The prior 41 site records and reviewed service metadata are unchanged.
- [x] Extend the strict artifact/schema/type contract to version 1.4 and add deterministic cohort,
      partial-depth, partial-date, score-exclusion, navigation-exclusion, and mobile truthfulness
      coverage. All ten locations retain `scoreDelta: null`; chart context cannot authorize access
      or imply shore-reachable depth, castability, wading safety, or navigation use.
- [x] Complete the fresh full local release matrix under pinned Node `22.23.1` and the
      hash-locked Python environments: fresh zero-script installation, both zero-vulnerability
      npm audits, Cloudflare build, 486/486 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete
      security/SBOM/source-integrity chain, 11 deterministic/adversarial structure-depth tests,
      Python syntax/Ruff, 29/29 API tests, 83/83 pipeline tests with one documented optional-
      `rasterio` skip, deterministic synthetic smoke, and all 19 critical D1 query plans passed.
      The complete CI-profile Chromium/WebKit phone matrix passed 180/180 cases. McNears partial
      evidence and Berkeley chart/date evidence were visually inspected from the production build
      at iPhone width.
- [x] Publish protected stacked draft PR `#137` without merge or deployment. Exact implementation
      head `88f307fd85cc7b1aadfad0c4d1dc2c19c233c5cb` passed push and pull-request CI runs
      `29826805729` (successful attempt 2 after attempt 1 was canceled when hosted browser
      installation stalled) and `29826824190`; release-provenance runs `29826805768` and
      `29826824260`; native API-image run `29826824184` on Linux AMD64 and ARM64; and explicitly
      dispatched optional research-stack run `29826828121` on Linux CPU and macOS ARM64. Hosted
      proof includes 486/486 Node tests, a 180/180 Chromium/WebKit mobile matrix, both zero-
      vulnerability audits, the secret/source-integrity/security chain, API and pipeline checks,
      and all 19 critical D1 query plans. Event-inapplicable dependency and release-attestation
      jobs skipped as designed.
- [ ] Obtain CodeQL evidence when this stack is eventually reviewed against protected `main`;
      default setup did not trigger on the non-default stacked base. Independent location/chart
      review, merge, deployment, provider/database mutation, and production activation remain

## Active checkpoint — Point Reyes and Marin Coast source-bound chart context

- [x] Preserve draft PR `#135` at exact final receipt head
      `0e6d5a72099f5da54c011f6606d34ffdd272fe02` as the reviewed stacked base. This
      follow-up uses another isolated worktree and does not merge, deploy, mutate Cloudflare or
      D1, change a catalog prior, or alter the attested fishing score.
- [x] Select the coherent seven-site exposed-coast cohort: Limantour Beach, Drakes Beach, Point
      Reyes South Beach, Bolinas Beach, Stinson Beach, Muir Beach, and Rodeo Beach. The same fixed
      NOAA ENC Direct `Approach` source, 13-layer inventory, meters/MLLW meaning, bounded geometry,
      and fail-closed drift rules apply.
- [x] Capture and normalize a fixed `2026-07-21T10:38:30Z` source snapshot for all 41 covered
      sites using 574 bounded layer queries. Five new sectors have one or more depth-area bands.
      Bolinas and Muir remain explicitly `partial`: both have nearby soundings and charted seabed
      records, but no reviewed depth-area band intersects the configured offshore sector. Crane
      Cove remains the earlier third partial site.
- [x] Extend the strict artifact/schema/type contract to version 1.3 and add deterministic cohort,
      partial-depth, partial-date, score-exclusion, navigation-exclusion, and mobile truthfulness
      coverage. All seven locations retain `scoreDelta: null`; chart context cannot authorize
      access or imply shore-reachable depth, castability, wading safety, or navigation use.
- [x] Complete the fresh full local release matrix under pinned Node `22.23.1` and the
      hash-locked Python environments: fresh zero-script installation, both zero-vulnerability
      npm audits, Cloudflare build, 485/485 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete
      security/SBOM/source-integrity chain, ten deterministic/adversarial structure-depth tests,
      Python syntax/Ruff, 29/29 API tests, 83/83 pipeline tests with one documented optional-
      `rasterio` skip, deterministic synthetic smoke, and all 19 critical D1 query plans passed.
      The complete Chromium/WebKit phone matrix passed 172/172 cases. Bolinas partial evidence and
      Drakes chart/date evidence were visually inspected from the production build at iPhone width.
- [x] Publish protected stacked draft PR `#136` without merge or deployment. Exact implementation
      head `69711aad640150385f4f3f5d1e8bf76f17f48236` passed push and pull-request CI runs

## Active checkpoint — San Mateo Coast and Half Moon Bay source-bound chart context

- [x] Preserve draft PR `#134` at exact final receipt head
      `f2ab34c8ca9968983a49e364235f86f16f91b4fa` as the reviewed stacked base. This
      follow-up is isolated from the dirty primary checkout and does not merge, deploy, mutate
      Cloudflare or D1, change a catalog prior, or alter the attested fishing score.
- [x] Select the next coherent ten-site cohort: Pacifica Municipal Pier, Sharp Park Beach,
      Rockaway Beach, Pacifica State Beach, Montara State Beach, both Pillar Point Harbor jetties,
      Surfer's Beach, Francis State Beach, and Poplar Beach. The same fixed NOAA ENC Direct
      `Approach` source, 13-layer inventory, meters/MLLW meaning, bounded geometry, and fail-closed
      drift rules apply.
- [x] Capture and normalize a fixed `2026-07-21T09:58:54Z` source snapshot for all 34 covered
      sites. Every new sector has one or more depth-area bands and at least one deduplicated
      sounding within 1 km. Existing Crane Cove evidence remains explicitly partial; no substitute
      source, catalog clue, or score value fills that gap.
- [x] Preserve access authority independently of chart coverage. Pacifica Municipal Pier remains
      closed and excluded from ranking and forecast/detail/trip-start flows; the main interface
      retains its official closure-status link. Chart context cannot authorize entry or weaken the
      closure.
- [x] Extend the strict artifact/schema/type contract to version 1.2 and add deterministic source,
      cohort, partial-date, score-exclusion, closed-access, and mobile truthfulness coverage.
- [x] Complete the fresh full local release matrix under pinned Node `22.23.1` and the
      hash-locked Python environments: fresh zero-script installation, both zero-vulnerability
      npm audits, Cloudflare build, 484/484 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete
      security/SBOM/source-integrity chain, nine deterministic/adversarial structure-depth tests,
      Python syntax/Ruff, 29/29 API tests, 83/83 pipeline tests with one documented optional-
      `rasterio` skip, deterministic synthetic smoke, and all 19 critical D1 query plans passed.
      The complete bounded two-worker Chromium/WebKit phone matrix passed 164/164 cases. Francis
      State Beach chart evidence and Pacifica Municipal Pier's closed-access boundary were
      visually inspected at iPhone width.

## Active checkpoint — San Francisco source-bound depth and structure

- [x] Preserve draft PR `#133` at exact final receipt head
      `3f2570a88731f13d42801de77047eb4eb6387edd` as the reviewed stacked base. This
      follow-up remains isolated from the dirty primary checkout and does not merge, deploy,
      mutate Cloudflare or D1, change the catalog, or modify the attested fishing score.
- [x] Extend the display-only NOAA ENC Direct `Approach` policy from the 14 Santa Barbara sites
      to ten reviewed San Francisco coast and waterfront sites. The policy now binds exactly 24
      covered site IDs and retains meters, MLLW, fixed source layers, checksums, bounded sectors,
      and fail-closed source and metadata drift handling.
- [x] Capture and deterministically normalize the fixed source for all 24 sites. Nine of ten San
      Francisco sites have one or more charted depth-area bands and a deduplicated sounding within
      1 km. Crane Cove Park is deliberately `partial`: no depth-area band intersects its configured
      220 m sector, while seven nearby point soundings and reviewed feature records remain visible.
      Exact, month-precision, year-precision, and missing source dates remain distinguishable.
- [x] Add truthful detail-sheet rendering for complete, partial, and unavailable chart evidence.
      The UI presents chart context without claiming castable depth, complete structure inventory,
      navigation use, access, wading safety, or score improvement. Torpedo Wharf and Crane Cove
      Park were visually inspected at iPhone width, and the focused truthfulness matrix passed all
      12 Chromium/WebKit phone cases.
- [x] Complete the clean full local release matrix under pinned Node `22.23.1` and hash-locked
      Python environments: fresh zero-script installation, both zero-vulnerability npm audits,
      Cloudflare build, 483/483 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete security/SBOM/source-
      integrity chain, strict schema validation, eight deterministic/adversarial collector tests,
      Python syntax/Ruff, 29/29 API tests, 83/83 pipeline tests with one documented optional-
      `rasterio` skip, deterministic synthetic smoke, and all 19 critical D1 query plans passed.
      The complete bounded two-worker Chromium/WebKit phone matrix passed 156/156 cases.
- [x] Publish protected stacked draft PR `#134` without merge or deployment. Exact implementation
      head `a7b9fe41d37e8f30a725fe55c99b1d7d59537d3a` passed push and pull-request CI runs
      `29819238921` and `29819273235`, including two independent 156/156 mobile matrices;
      release-provenance runs `29819238944` and `29819273244`; native API-image run `29819273236`
      on both architectures; and explicitly dispatched optional research-stack run `29819301646`

## Active checkpoint — Santa Barbara source-bound depth and structure

- [x] Preserve the green stacked demo base on draft PR `#132` at exact head
      `20b31eb31136481f160add020caa2f742a6da49a`. This work uses another isolated stacked
      branch and does not merge, deploy, mutate Cloudflare, alter D1, or rewrite the attested
      score or original Bay Area validation geography.
- [x] Freeze a display-only source policy for the exact 14 Santa Barbara South Coast locations.
      The source review records why current BlueTopo coverage (3/14 configured sectors) and the
      USGS 2012 10 m NAVD88 grid (6/14) cannot support a uniform regional claim, then selects only
      NOAA ENC Direct's `Approach` usage band. The product remains vector chart context in meters
      and MLLW, with no fixed grid resolution or exposed numeric positional/vertical uncertainty.
- [x] Capture a normalized fixed-source snapshot and produce a strict, hash-bound artifact for
      all 14 sites. Every site has one or more charted sector bands and a deduplicated point
      sounding within 1 km; selected nearby records are limited to reviewed chart feature classes.
      Overlapping cells and partial source dates remain explicit. Exact feature geometry stays out
      of the public artifact, `scoreDelta` is null, catalog mutation is forbidden, and source or
      metadata drift fails closed.
- [x] Add the chart evidence to each regional detail sheet without claiming a castable depth,
      complete structure inventory, navigation use, access, wading safety, or score improvement.
      The Goleta rendering was visually inspected at iPhone width, and the exact truthfulness and
      viewport contract passed 4/4 Chromium/WebKit phone cases.
- [x] Complete the final full local receipt under pinned Node `22.23.1`: Cloudflare build plus
      482/482 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, Python syntax/Ruff, strict schema validation, seven
      deterministic/adversarial collector tests, the complete security/SBOM/source-integrity
      chain, five release-wrapper tests, and zero-vulnerability full and production npm audits
      passed. A resource-saturated four-worker phone attempt passed 133/148; all 15 unrelated
      timing/setup failures then passed 15/15 alone, and the clean bounded two-worker Chromium/
      WebKit matrix passed 148/148.
- [x] Publish stacked draft PR `#133` without merge or deployment. Exact final receipt head
      `3f2570a88731f13d42801de77047eb4eb6387edd` passed push and pull-request CI runs
      `29816560795` and `29816563951`, release-provenance runs `29816560802` and `29816563860`,
      native API-image run `29816563887` on both architectures, and explicitly dispatched optional
      research-stack run `29816580920` on Linux CPU and macOS ARM64. Event-inapplicable dependency
      and release-attestation jobs skipped as designed; the immutable receipt is recorded on the
      draft PR.
- [ ] Obtain CodeQL evidence when this stack is eventually reviewed against protected `main`;
      GitHub default setup did not trigger on the non-default stacked base, so this checkpoint makes
      no CodeQL claim. Independent local-angler/site review, higher-resolution coverage, scoring
      validation, merge, and guarded production acceptance also remain separate open gates.

## Active checkpoint — Santa Barbara exclusion-only water-contact actions

- [x] Preserve the green regional demo base on draft PR `#131` at exact head
      `5696ea80afedd7085dc945796bb20bfd64e3fafd`. This follow-up uses a separate stacked branch;
      it does not modify, merge, deploy, or invalidate that demo receipt.
- [x] Freeze the second official-source boundary. The California State Water Resources Control
      Board BeachWatch action table is action-only: an exact current `Closure`, `Posting`, or
      `Rain` row may suppress a recommendation, but an absent, ended, future, malformed, or
      unavailable action never becomes a neutral/clean/safe claim and never changes the numeric
      score.
- [x] Bind all 14 Santa Barbara South Coast catalog sites to explicit countywide actions; bind 11
      of those sites to direct reviewed station IDs and leave Mesa Lane, the Harbor Breakwater,
      and Stearns Wharf countywide-only. Exact closure/posting/rain precedence, start/end dates,
      independent source failures, and source-specific unknown behavior are machine checked.
- [x] Extend the artifact contract, collector, browser types/UI, deterministic XML/HTML fixtures,
      and adversarial tests. The v2 artifact exposes both official sources and action dates while
      retaining null `scoreDelta` everywhere. The focused 11-test suite, TypeScript, and ESLint
      pass under pinned Node `22.23.1`.
- [x] Exercise the adapter against both fixed live official endpoints without changing a provider.
      The `2026-07-21T07:20:00Z` read-only snapshot parsed both sources, retained absent actions as
      unknown, and reported open-ended State Board postings for Gaviota and Refugio. The snapshot
      is time-bound review evidence, not a live guarantee or safety claim.
- [x] Complete the full local implementation receipt under pinned Node `22.23.1` and the locked
      Python environments: Cloudflare build plus 475/475 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the
      complete security/SBOM/source-integrity chain, and zero-vulnerability full and production
      npm audits passed. The exact Python gates passed 29/29 API tests, Ruff, 83/83 pipeline tests
      with one documented optional-`rasterio` skip, the deterministic synthetic smoke, and 19
      migrations / 19 critical D1 query plans with every foreign-key child path indexed. The full
      Chromium/WebKit phone matrix passed 144/144 cases.
- [x] Publish protected draft PR `#132` without merge or deployment. Exact final head
      `20b31eb31136481f160add020caa2f742a6da49a` passed push and pull-request CI runs
      `29811484371` and `29811505876`, release-provenance runs `29811484319` and `29811505848`,
      native API-image run `29811505926` on both architectures, and explicitly dispatched optional
      research-stack run `29817324038` on Linux CPU and macOS ARM64. Event-inapplicable jobs skipped
      as designed.
- [ ] Obtain CodeQL evidence when this stack is eventually reviewed against protected `main`;
      default setup did not trigger on the non-default stacked base. Independent mapping and source-
      latency review, remaining launch-catalog coverage, merge, deployment, provider/database
      mutation, and production action remain separate open gates.

## Active checkpoint — non-production regional and water-quality demo integration

- [x] Reconcile protected `main` `086b2055f44ba5e2595d6bd249866ffb20c3c461`, draft
      regional PR `#118`, draft water-quality PR `#130`, issue `#86`, and the ordered roadmap.
      All remaining P0/P1 provider, counsel, staging, deployment, independent-review, and
      real-data gates remain open; this integration cannot satisfy or bypass them.
- [x] Preserve the reviewed Santa Barbara South Coast expansion from Gaviota through Rincon:
      14 public-access catalog entries, three NOAA tide anchors, West/East Channel buoy routing,
      the Campus Point no-take exclusion, a 2,160-window source-bound snapshot, truthful regional
      search language, and the original Bay Area validation geography frozen byte-for-byte.
      The score remains an explainable relative ranking, never a catch probability.
- [x] Preserve the local-access evidence boundary. The blank 14-site packet and offline evaluator
      remain machine-bound, privacy-minimizing, and non-authorizing. No review response has been
      supplied or accepted; every regional site remains pending, including five limited-access
      sites requiring two independent reviews. Regional trip reports remain ordinary private
      product observations rather than validation evidence.
- [x] Preserve water quality as a separately versioned human-health advisory overlay, not a
      catch-probability, pollution-severity, or seafood-safety score. The fixed HTTPS SFPUC slice
      maps six exact San Francisco sites, rejects malformed or unreviewed source states, binds
      policy/collector/catalog hashes, independently expires neutral evidence, and suppresses a
      recommendation under a current active official status without rewriting its fishing score.
      Fresh no-posting evidence is neutral; stale, unavailable, unmapped, or incomplete evidence
      remains explicitly unknown.
- [x] Preserve the two independent exact-head receipts. Regional PR `#118` head
      `0c90f1afe08b9f8866b26d3bfeef07f541d226e8` passed all applicable hosted checks, including
      140/140 mobile cases. Water-quality PR `#130` implementation head
      `c6d261925168cff33b930413ddf1b0c770ad215c` and receipt head
      `3ac7bec5a3410bf0bdeb0de500e43a1fa7b1025b` passed push/PR CI, CodeQL, both native API-image
      architectures, release provenance, and the complete 144/144 mobile matrix.
- [x] Verify the combined non-production working tree from source. The advisory artifact was
      regenerated against the 61-site catalog; the Cloudflare build and 472/472 Node tests,
      144/144 Chromium/WebKit mobile cases, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete security/SBOM/source-
      integrity chain and both zero-vulnerability npm audits passed under pinned Node `22.23.1`.
      Exact Python environments passed 29/29 API tests, Ruff, 83/83 pipeline tests with one
      documented optional-`rasterio` skip, the deterministic synthetic smoke, and 19 migrations /
      19 critical D1 query plans with every foreign-key child path indexed.
- [x] Add a bounded [ML-engineer demo runbook](ML-ENGINEER-DEMO.md) that identifies what the
      local candidate demonstrates, what remains unvalidated, and which actions stay outside the
      demo. Docker, provider access, production credentials, Cloudflare, and deployment are not
      required.
- [x] Bind the fully verified implementation tree to merge commit
      `ec2d5bc26429eca1a7e45bbef62bfc5c0775d198`, whose parents are the reviewed regional head
      `0c90f1afe08b9f8866b26d3bfeef07f541d226e8` and water-quality receipt head
      `3ac7bec5a3410bf0bdeb0de500e43a1fa7b1025b`.
- [x] Publish documentation-only receipt head
      `378079d1613e3ef8c73505d44c1a496bff56f7ca` as draft integration PR `#131` and require
      exact-head hosted evidence. Push CI `29808408226` and pull-request CI `29808462035` passed,
      including two independent 144/144 mobile browser matrices, API, pipeline, dependency review,
      and zero-vulnerability audits. CodeQL `29808460165` passed all three languages; release-
      provenance runs `29808408273` and `29808461894`, native API-image run `29808461966`, and
      optional research-stack run `29808462019` also passed. Event-inapplicable attestation and
      dependency-submission jobs skipped as designed.
- [x] Keep the candidate draft-only for the ML-engineer demo. PR `#131` remains a draft; no merge,
      deployment, Cloudflare/provider mutation, database migration, or production activation ran.
      It must not merge or deploy until the Santa Barbara access review, guarded production
      checklist, and every other open gate above are independently satisfied. Structure/depth
      mapping and broader official water-quality coverage remain separate unchecked roadmap goals.

## Completed work cycle — deterministic mobile release evidence

- [x] Reconcile protected `main` after privacy-export PR `#127`. Exact merge commit
      `5756146d061dce9aa3ba63aef73f0d34bde4a21b` passed release provenance, both native API-image
      architectures, all three CodeQL languages, API, pipeline, dependency submission, and the
      complete web job after one failed-job rerun on the unchanged commit. No deployment,
      provider query, binding, migration, or production mutation ran.
- [x] Classify the failed main web result from run `29794888259` using its exact log rather than
      rerunning blindly. One WebKit case missed the reopened trip dialog; the exact case passed
      12/12 local repetitions and both pre-merge hosted web jobs. The prior main failure was a
      different WebKit lazy-map detachment, establishing a release-gate synchronization risk
      rather than a privacy-export regression.
- [x] Harden only the observed test boundaries. Recovery setup waits for the mocked authenticated
      `Profile` state and uses the fixed topbar trip control; close/reopen coverage proves the old
      dialog is hidden and the replacement is visible before checking the restored ambiguous
      state. Lazy-map scrolling now runs inside the existing retry and re-resolves the map after
      React replacement. Product behavior, timeouts, retries, and provider state are unchanged.
- [x] Stress the two revised WebKit boundaries sequentially in the clean worktree: trip recovery
      passed 10/10 and lazy-map loading passed 10/10. Earlier artificial concurrent repetition
      attempts were discarded after the machine reached temporary-storage and unrelated system-
      load saturation; no assertion result from that polluted environment is treated as evidence.
- [x] Classify draft PR `#128`'s first exact head rather than rerunning it. Both independent hosted
      web jobs passed 137/140 and failed the same three WebKit trip-network cases at one redundant
      location-option click: entering the exact site name had already committed the selection, then
      React replaced the suggestion during that second action. The helper no longer clicks
      replaceable option DOM, with no product or timeout change. The exact three-case cluster then
      passed 30/30 concurrent WebKit repetitions and the complete two-worker mobile matrix passed
      140/140 locally.
- [x] Classify the final receipt head's asymmetric hosted result. Its push web job passed 140/140;
      its pull-request web job passed 139/140 and showed one iPhone SE worker receiving the location
      catalog after the exact query was entered, leaving one matching result but no committed
      selection. The helper now waits for that result and selects it through the stable combobox
      keyboard contract, then proves the selected-site status and moves focus through the next real
      form control. The affected slice passed 60/60 two-worker repetitions across iPhone SE and
      WebKit, then 12/12 across all four mobile projects. No timeout, product behavior, provider
      state, or production state changed.
- [x] Complete the ordinary local release matrix. The exact two-worker hosted-CI shape passed all
      140 mobile cases, including both revised WebKit boundaries. Fresh npm installation, the
      Cloudflare build, 456/456 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete security/SBOM/query-
      inventory chain and both zero-vulnerability npm audits, 29/29 API tests, Ruff, 19/19 D1
      query plans with every foreign-key child path indexed, 81/81 pipeline tests with one
      documented optional-raster skip, and the deterministic pipeline smoke all passed.
- [x] Publish protected draft PR `#128` and obtain complete exact-head hosted evidence for repaired
      implementation head `d7c02e5867657a16f3e51f0bec559c2297d8572d`. Push CI run
      `29797876950` and pull-request CI run `29797878595` each passed the complete web job with
      140/140 mobile cases plus API and pipeline; CodeQL run `29797877045` passed all three
      languages; release-provenance runs `29797876952` and `29797878558` passed. Skips were the
      event-inapplicable attestation, dependency-review, and dependency-submission jobs.
- [x] Require the final PR `#128` head to pass protected checks before merge. Exact head
      `8aec61bb05b45213ee1bc27b7c1c98f11ae42a1c` passed push CI run `29798632628` and
      pull-request CI run `29798634349`, including two independent 140/140 web jobs, plus CodeQL
      run `29798632819` and release-provenance runs `29798632624` and `29798634244`. It then
      merged as protected-main commit `26811fd3f5e4332a264af9e4e7c3f9078e745caf`.
- [x] Classify that merge commit's failed web job rather than rerunning it. Main CI run
      `29799012204` passed API, pipeline, and dependency submission but passed 139/140 mobile
      cases: one WebKit trip-recovery setup never received `Limantour Beach`. The app loads its
      site catalog and 2.9 MB forecast snapshot atomically, and the Vinext test server's recorded
      premature close on the snapshot correctly left the app on its three-site emergency
      fallback. CodeQL run `29799011924` and release-provenance run `29799012244` passed.
- [x] Classify draft follow-up PR `#129`'s first exact head rather than rerunning it. Its push web
      job passed 140/140 while its pull-request web job passed 139/140; the same WebKit setup
      missed `Limantour Beach`. Routing the exact 2.9 MB forecast around Vinext had removed the
      premature-close dependency but still made catalog publication wait for an irrelevant large
      transfer and parse. That transport is not part of trip-mutation recovery.
- [x] Classify PR `#129`'s second exact head rather than rerunning it. Its push web job again
      passed 140/140 while its pull-request web job passed 139/140 at the same setup. Reducing the
      forecast to a tiny schema-valid payload ruled out forecast size. A subsequent local WebKit
      trace showed the trip form already held a valid selected location while the driver waited
      for a replaceable combobox option. The failure was in unrelated catalog interaction, not the
      mutation-recovery behavior under test.
- [x] Isolate the mutation-recovery boundary completely. Only the three trip-recovery cases now
      use the form's already-valid default location and assert its stable selected-status contract.
      The past-report endpoint remains mocked, and the cases no longer type into the catalog,
      inspect transient option DOM, route static data, or make any catalog-ready timing assumption.
      Product behavior, public data, timeouts, retries, Cloudflare, and production are unchanged.
      With a fresh server on every run, the final driver passed 60/60 focused iPhone SE and WebKit
      repetitions and the exact two-worker four-project matrix passed 140/140, including while
      Vinext reproduced the irrelevant static-file premature-close warning. ESLint, TypeScript,
      the Cloudflare build, 456/456 Node tests, secret and install-policy checks, and both complete
      and production-only npm audits also passed. Hosted exact-head evidence remains required below.
- [x] Publish the isolated follow-up, require complete exact-head protected checks, merge only
      accepted evidence, and reconcile protected `main`. PR `#129` exact head
      `02d0789cda4c05d5d9ea81557aea31ec66a8b6c0` passed push CI `29801444205` and
      pull-request CI `29801446092`, including two independent 140/140 Chromium/WebKit web jobs,
      plus CodeQL `29801444300` and release-provenance runs `29801444203` and `29801446067`.
      It merged as protected-main commit `086b2055f44ba5e2595d6bd249866ffb20c3c461`;
      main CI `29801749298`, CodeQL `29801748832`, and release provenance `29801749264`
      passed that exact commit. Production and Cloudflare remained outside this cycle.

## Completed work cycle — default-off asynchronous privacy exports

- [x] Reconcile protected `main`, draft regional PR `#118`, draft asynchronous-export PR `#127`,
      issue `#86`, and the P1 scale roadmap without touching Cloudflare or production. Starting
      `main` is `a9f1efc1d0b7d095ed8b71738b403d1cdc1b23f9`; both draft PRs remain open.
- [x] Independently audit the complete default-off export path. Queue messages remain limited to
      an opaque job ID, D1 remains authoritative, objects remain private and owner-bound for 24
      hours, retries and expiry are bounded, account deletion adopts committed objects, and no
      producer/consumer or R2 provider binding is configured. Migration `0019` remains unapplied,
      the feature remains off, and no provider or production change was made.
- [x] Close the download-integrity gap found during that audit. Every download now recomputes the
      D1 object-locator hash and rejects any mismatch in the recorded byte count, SHA-256 upload
      metadata, or export-contract version before reading or streaming the private object. All
      integrity failures use one generic 503 response and a bounded error code; adversarial tests
      prove neither responses nor logs expose account, job, email, or object-locator identity.
- [x] Freeze the four download-integrity bindings in the machine-checked export policy, document
      the boundary in the export and data-lifecycle runbooks, regenerate the D1 source inventory,
      and bind the revised artifacts into the combined release SBOM. The check does not claim a
      full byte rehash on download or any provider/deployment evidence.
- [x] Complete the local release-sized verification matrix. A fresh npm `10.9.8` no-script install
      restored 533 packages and both audits found zero vulnerabilities; Cloudflare build,
      456/456 Node tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit mobile cases, ESLint, TypeScript, and every
      offline security/SBOM/query-inventory gate passed. Exact Python environments passed 29/29
      API tests, Ruff, 81/81 pipeline tests with one documented optional-raster skip, the
      deterministic synthetic smoke, 19 migrations, 19 critical query plans, and every
      foreign-key child index contract.
- [x] Complete the protected workflow without provider mutation. PR `#127` exact implementation
      head `719d4c3c142dbb0e029a6583aa86f122777fbc6a` passed push and pull-request CI, release
      provenance, CodeQL, and both native API-image architectures, then merged as protected-main
      commit `5756146d061dce9aa3ba63aef73f0d34bde4a21b`. Main CI run `29794888259` attempt 2 passed
      the unchanged commit, including 140/140 mobile cases; release provenance `29794888254`,
      API image security `29794888264`, and CodeQL `29794887894` also passed. Provider setup,
      migration `0019`, Queue/DLQ/R2/IAM/alerts, staging failure and deletion drills, activation,
      and production release remain separate reviewed gates.

## Completed work cycle — complete D1 query inventory

- [x] Reconcile protected `main`, draft regional PR `#118`, draft query-inventory PR `#125`, open
      issue `#86`, and the scale roadmap without touching Cloudflare or production. Starting
      `main` is `7ed0f97c499e853b6a3d1a5b6f8c9ef82e70ef2d`; both draft PRs remain open.
- [x] Identify the earliest repository-actionable P1 gap. Existing evidence covered 14
      representative plans but did not inventory every production D1 statement, so query source
      coverage and remaining unbounded reads could not be independently audited.
- [x] Implement a deterministic TypeScript-AST inventory for all 221 direct Worker `.prepare()`
      sites across eight files: 195 literal statements, 26 exact reviewed nonliteral expressions,
      and 12 reviewed literal multi-row reads without `LIMIT`. The gate rejects source drift,
      computed/aliased prepare access, unreviewed dynamic SQL, unscoped literal writes, and
      unreviewed multi-row reads.
- [x] Preserve truthful scale boundaries. Nine reads are complete authenticated rights exports
      and two are owner-lifecycle cleanup reads. The four saved-site/gear UI reads now use exact
      100-item account ceilings, `LIMIT 101` overflow detection, atomic count-guarded creates, and
      fail-closed legacy overflow without truncating rights exports. Complete export packaging,
      scheduled-cleanup batching, and isolated latency/load evidence remain open.
- [x] Resolve the newly published high-severity `brace-expansion` advisory in both locked
      development-tool paths by moving exactly from `1.1.14` to `1.1.16` and `5.0.6` to `5.0.7`.
      A fresh npm `10.9.8` zero-script install completed with 534 audited packages and both full
      and production-only audits returned zero vulnerabilities; no dependency lifecycle script
      ran.
- [x] Bound all five scheduled authentication/retention delete statements to 100 selected primary
      rows per table and invocation. A 101-row fixture proves one eligible row remains after the
      first run, the next run drains it, and current rows survive; all five actual statements use
      the intended indexes. Existing privacy cleanup remains bounded to 50 tasks and 100-job
      reconciliation. Completed-job child-cascade cost still needs isolated staging evidence.
- [x] Reconcile the already-enforced cache and connection boundaries into the owner checklist.
      The complete cache matrix and fail-closed API/PWA rules are locally tested; the Worker uses
      provider-managed D1 bindings, while the optional Postgres service owns one validated bounded
      pool. Edge purge/rollover evidence and provider-sized pool telemetry/exhaustion drills remain
      isolated-staging gates rather than implied production evidence.
- [x] Bind the policy and generated query ledger into CI, the combined release SBOM, and the
      deterministic release archive; add a 15th representative query-plan check for gear-profile
      ordering. Focused adversarial tests, ESLint, and all 15 plans pass.
- [x] Complete the full locked verification matrix. A fresh zero-script npm install audited 534
      packages with zero vulnerabilities; every offline security/SBOM gate, both npm audits,
      ESLint, TypeScript, the Cloudflare build, 441/441 Node tests, and 140/140 Chromium/WebKit
      mobile cases passed. The saved-location recovery cases use their committed forecast
      fixture's recorded clock, so their recovery assertions cannot expire with wall-clock time.
      Exact locked Python graphs passed 29/29 API tests, 81/81 pipeline tests
      with one documented optional-raster skip, Ruff, the deterministic synthetic smoke, 18
      migrations, 15 representative query plans, and every foreign-key child index contract.
- [x] Publish protected draft PR `#125` at exact head
      `0808c732c8210bd4d2f47e4f37a38c2f03361f55`; all applicable hosted checks passed. No
      deployment, D1 migration, provider query, or production mutation was part of that receipt.
- [x] Publish the local account-ceiling and bounded-retention follow-up on draft PR `#125` at
      exact implementation head `fe54c2d2152cabd793c7b83996b35584d9d06672`. Push and pull-request
      CI runs `29787542366` and `29787543587`, release-provenance runs `29787542385` and
      `29787543547`, and CodeQL run `29787542188` passed. The path-filtered native workflow was
      also dispatched explicitly at that exact head: run `29787982359` built, health-checked,
      inventoried, and policy-scanned both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Its three known high
      CPython findings match the reviewed, module-removal-backed exceptions that expire
      2026-08-08; no new exception was added. No deployment, D1 migration, Cloudflare change, or
      production mutation occurred during that exact-head receipt.
- [x] Exercise the actual built Worker against a disposable local D1 database with all 18
      migrations, not the earlier synthetic HTTP server. Wrangler local HTTPS returned the
      hardened D1-backed health response and the bounded smoke profile completed 2,835 requests
      with zero failures, 18.51 ms p95, and 32.79 ms p99. This is developer-machine evidence only;
      isolated production-shaped staging load, soak, spike, failure injection, provider metrics,
      and cost evidence remain open.
- [x] Merge accepted PR `#125` as protected-main commit
      `cd5aa41a4e01bda59bbbd44b968730e1ba956785`. Main CI `29788509904`, release provenance
      `29788509895`, and all three CodeQL languages plus aggregate upload in `29788509768` passed.
      The merge did not run a deployment command, migration, provider query, or production
      mutation and is not evidence that the live Worker changed.

## Completed repository work cycle — independent operational restore-review gate

- [x] Reconcile protected `main`, draft regional PR `#118`, the owner roadmap, and the existing
      synthetic restore/deletion-replay evidence boundary. Starting `main` is
      `80b347c2a24dbab82543c107effd5a8b8d3c55fa`; production and provider state remain untouched.
- [x] Identify the earliest repository-actionable P0 gap. The synthetic restore packet existed,
      but no locked workflow could bind a separately supplied source commit, private packet,
      independent reviewer, strict review chronology, and privacy-minimized public receipt while
      keeping every production authorization claim false.
- [x] Freeze the independent-review boundary in a versioned policy and exact JSON Schema. The
      policy permits only the three expected packet files and audit identities, requires all
      acceptance checks and separation attestations, limits the review window to seven days, and
      prohibits reviewer identity, paths, provider details, audit content, and private evidence
      hashes from the public receipt.
- [x] Implement the offline verifier, operator/reviewer runbook, deterministic safe receipt, and
      adversarial tests. Canonical JSON, full source identity, file ownership/mode/type/link
      boundaries, immutable packet hashes, audit chronology/hash chain, reviewer separation, and
      private-note independence all fail closed. The verifier performs no network or provider
      action and cannot approve key custody, provider evidence, deployment, or production release.
- [x] Complete clean local verification. A fresh zero-script npm install audited 534 packages
      with zero vulnerabilities; Cloudflare build, 436/436 Node tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit
      mobile cases, ESLint, TypeScript, every offline security/SBOM gate, five Python lock graphs,
      and both npm audits passed. The exact Python graphs passed 29/29 API tests, 81/81 pipeline
      tests with one documented optional-raster skip, Ruff, the deterministic synthetic smoke,
      18 migrations, and 14 critical query plans.
- [x] Publish and merge the accepted implementation without deployment or provider mutation.
      PR `#124` final head `04f808f7fe165b856898c951fcac440cd2ba101d` merged as protected-main
      commit `7ed0f97c499e853b6a3d1a5b6f8c9ef82e70ef2d`. Main CI `29722159901`, release
      provenance and attestations `29722159925`, native API-image security `29722159912`, and
      CodeQL `29722159592` passed; both web engines, all three CodeQL languages, both image
      architectures, and dependency submission completed successfully. No Cloudflare, D1, DNS,
      deployment, migration, provider query, or production mutation ran.
- [ ] Obtain a real second-person review of the private historical packet outside Git. Until that
      reviewer supplies a valid private record and the verifier accepts it, independent review,
      production key custody, provider evidence, the restore gate, and release authorization all
      remain open.

## Completed work cycle — API image upstream watch

- [x] Reconcile protected `main`, draft regional PR `#118`, the owner roadmap, and GitHub work.
      Starting `main` is `4f20a786c8a88cce7104be7a73f012fca1440f02`; `#118` remains the only
      open PR and issue `#86` remains the only open issue. Production is untouched.
- [x] Identify the earliest repository-actionable P0 gap. The weekly native image scan runs on
      Monday, while Python 3.13.15 is scheduled for Tuesday 2026-08-04 and the bounded exception
      expires Saturday 2026-08-08, leaving a detection gap during the replacement window.
- [x] Implement a dependency-free daily/manual, read-only primary-source watch with bounded
      requests. Offline policy and adversarial fixture tests pass 5/5; a live 2026-07-20 check
      confirms Python `3.13.14`, source SHA-256
      `639e43243c620a308f968213df9e00f2f8f62332f7adbaa7a7eeb9783057c690`, source revision
      `f79aea5b8f6b2d65b31ba2bb3f69c0c2083345c8`, and AMD64/ARM64 publication remain current.
- [x] Regenerate the deterministic release inventory and pass the complete clean local gate.
      A fresh zero-script npm install audited 534 packages with zero vulnerabilities; the
      Cloudflare build, 430/430 Node tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit mobile cases, ESLint,
      TypeScript, every offline security/SBOM gate, five Python lock graphs, and both npm audits
      passed. Fresh hash-locked Python graphs passed 29/29 API tests and 81/81 pipeline tests
      with one documented optional-raster skip, 14 critical query plans, Ruff, and deterministic
      smoke. The local Homebrew Python 3.13.14 `pyexpat`/system-library mismatch prevents a clean
      exact-runtime API environment, so hosted CI remains the exact Python 3.13.14 authority.
- [x] Publish the exact accepted implementation head through protected CI, provenance, CodeQL,
      and native image checks without deployment or provider mutation. Draft PR `#121` head
      `20cd657686a9bd7e1ec8bfbac9c5742c37879f06` passed PR CI `29716510562`, release
      provenance `29716510577`, CodeQL `29716509307`, and native image security `29716510583`;
      duplicate branch-push CI `29716478066` and release provenance `29716478086` also passed.
      Fifteen checks succeeded and five event-appropriate jobs skipped. Both web runs completed
      all 140 Chromium/WebKit cases, hosted API used exact Python 3.13.14, and both native image
      architectures passed. No Cloudflare, D1, DNS, provider, or production action ran.
- [x] Merge only accepted evidence and reconcile exact protected `main`, workflows, alerts, and
      issue `#86`. PR `#121` merged normally as
      `8c051080abcb3f19b6ab7bc36f6aed67c5bb9f87`; main CI `29717064849`, release
      provenance `29717064802`, native API image security `29717064831`, and CodeQL
      `29717064180` passed. Manual main watch run `29717078040` also passed. Dependabot,
      code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts were all zero; issue `#86` remains open until a
      fixed image passes both native architectures. No deployment or provider mutation ran.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — privacy-safe observability evidence

- [x] Reconcile protected `main`, draft PR `#119`, the owner roadmap, and the current API-image
      exception schedule. Starting `main` was
      `127841eeb34134a4d32cdbb4853852486ec6b4c5`; Python `3.13.14` remains the current stable
      `3.13` image target and the bounded issue `#86` review is not yet due. Production and
      provider state remained untouched.
- [x] Audit the offline incident drill and activation verifier against their exact public claims.
      The prior draft accepted a completion before later request events, a terminal operation
      before its start, equal timestamps, and a reviewed commit asserted only inside the private
      manifest. Green tests for that head therefore did not prove chronology or independent
      release binding.
- [x] Make reconstruction fail closed: timestamps must increase strictly within every correlation
      identity, request completion must be last, operation start/terminal events must be first and
      last, and every terminal event must contain its bounded duration. Adversarial tests cover
      late request events, terminal-before-start operations, and equal timestamps.
- [x] Bind activation evidence to an independently supplied full Git commit, refuse missing,
      malformed, mismatched, or widened evaluation options, expose the reviewed commit in the
      public-safe receipt, and continue excluding private evidence hashes, provider identifiers,
      saved-view names, actor pseudonyms, and raw payloads. Every boolean is validated even when
      an earlier gate is false, so malformed later claims cannot hide behind short-circuit logic.
- [x] Verify exact implementation head `986271b9bed89a1adc5c977ec2037383c5f5f19f`
      locally: 15/15 focused observability tests, the deterministic 10-event/2-request/3-operation
      drill receipt `97ad05561b2221b816d7cd01091d752458de7a3903698ce44726680835c81a94`,
      Cloudflare build and 425/425 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, every offline security gate,
      both SBOMs, five Python lock graphs, and both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities passed.
- [x] Publish only that accepted head and merge after every hosted gate passed. PR `#119` CI
      `29713750801` and `29713751946`, release provenance `29713750823` and `29713751885`, and
      CodeQL `29713750743` passed; 13 checks succeeded, five event-appropriate jobs skipped, and
      none failed. No workflow deployed or queried Cloudflare.
- [x] Reconcile protected `main` after the merge. PR `#119` merged normally as
      `d71f17cad8642c09c8f64460ce3c8ef1cba55555`; main CI `29714019076`, release provenance
      `29714019090`, and CodeQL `29714018857` passed that exact commit, including the hosted
      Chromium/WebKit mobile matrix and dependency submission. Dependabot, code-scanning, and
      secret-scanning alerts are all zero. The provider dashboard, IAM/retention/cost evidence,
      uptime checks, delivered alerts, preview/production reconstruction, and production release
      remain open; this repository receipt does not authorize them.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — SEO language and provider evidence

- [x] Reconcile protected `main` and the existing crawl contract. Starting `main` was
      `6aaad6e4252fa7f873ac0f95196cb61281fd89bb`; the intended public set remains exactly `/`,
      `/privacy`, `/terms`, and `/ai-disclosure`, while `/profile` remains crawlable but
      `noindex, nofollow` and absent from the sitemap. Production is active, drifted, and untouched.
- [x] Recheck current official Google and Bing guidance and freeze the truthful boundary. Titles
      and descriptions are search-result preferences, not guaranteed output; a sitemap or URL
      request does not prove crawling, indexing, ranking, or traffic; and dashboard creation does
      not prove ownership. Candidate phrases are audience-research prompts, not keyword-stuffing
      instructions or performance predictions.
- [x] Create the four-page language sheet and prohibited-claim matrix. Every page has an honest
      purpose, audience questions, candidate phrases, current title/description, desired snippet,
      and useful next action. The strategy rejects catch-probability, outcome/superiority,
      validation/training, freshness/regulation/access/safety, agency-endorsement, search-status,
      and production-parity overclaims while preserving the narrower heuristic relative-ranking
      truth.
- [x] Create the private Google/Bing evidence workflow. It separates dashboard creation,
      ownership, sitemap submission/processing, live URL testing, indexing request, observed
      indexing, and performance; permits only secret-free operational fields; and keeps raw and
      redacted screenshots outside Git. DNS/HTML verification values, account identifiers,
      credentials, recovery codes, billing details, and user/trip data are prohibited.
- [x] Add the fail-closed machine policy and tests. `seo/language-policy.json` binds the exact
      four-page set and metadata, keeps `/profile` excluded, rejects prohibited strategy phrases
      and token-shaped material, and fixes every Google/Bing action to `false`. The goal dashboard
      closes only the language-sheet task; dashboard ownership/verification and all provider,
      deployment, indexing, coverage, performance, and Core Web Vitals work remain open.
- [x] Publish the exact accepted head without a provider or production action. Local Cloudflare
      build plus 400/400 Node tests, ESLint, TypeScript, secrets, the exact npm 10.9.8 integrated
      security/SBOM/provenance chain, and both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities passed.
      Protected PR `#113` at exact head `0b514951effd066d9b4cbef90ac767cac8baded2` passed PR CI
      `29697668825`, release provenance `29697668861`, and CodeQL `29697667897`, including
      dependency review, hosted API and pipeline suites, and 140/140 Chromium/WebKit browser
      cases. Duplicate branch-push CI `29697667318` and release provenance `29697667340` also
      passed on their original attempts.
- [x] Merge only the accepted head and add the immutable protected-`main` receipt. PR `#113`
      merged normally as `f362707f68dd77b243a0b9b8863b8240a0073e2c` without admin bypass,
      squash, rebase, provider mutation, or production change. Its tree
      `e75a7d2d57a2cf909a36df50bf91cdc76c58d3e5` exactly equals the fully green accepted-head
      tree. As of `2026-07-19T18:04:27Z`, GitHub had created zero push check suites for that merge
      commit despite accepting it on protected `main`; this receipt therefore makes no claim of
      exact-merge CI, CodeQL, release, SBOM-attestation, or deployment evidence. The identical
      protected PR tree evidence above remains the acceptance evidence. Open PRs and open
      Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts were all zero; issue `#86` remains
      open by design. Production remains active, drifted, and untouched. The broader SEO parent
      remains open for reviewed deployment, Google/Bing verification and provider operations,
      observed indexing/coverage, Core Web Vitals, and privacy-reviewed measurement.

      Follow-up PR `#115` added the machine-bound public all-zero validation status and passed
      exact-head CI `29699233614`, release provenance `29699233623`, and CodeQL
      `29699534489` at `9c6d491824aeed04feba6c768a272e2325579b9c`. It merged as
      `7f84cd19ec0e8742d55d6483d14c82b7f42a567d`; the merge tree
      `6f5e12b859d64a8b5607347ad4818ebc7979466e` exactly equals the accepted-head tree.
      Main CI `29701986309`, release provenance `29701986318`, and CodeQL `29701986114`
      passed that exact merge, including 140/140 browser cases, hosted API and pipeline suites,
      dependency submission, release/SBOM attestations, and all three CodeQL languages.
      Production and provider configuration remain untouched; this is code and evidence receipt,
      not deployment or validation evidence.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — production change authorization

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main` and inventory every production mutation entry point.
      Starting `main` is `41e83dff77b8bcca9e42a4ef2f4cdf9e7b58f1d8`; the active, drifted Worker
      and all provider resources remain untouched.
- [x] Freeze the authorization boundary. Each Worker deploy, `0007` reconciliation, and exact
      `0009`–`0018` migration requires its own canonical private packet outside every checkout,
      full reviewed release and gate commits, a window no longer than six hours, distinct operator
      and independent-reviewer evidence, and the action-specific phase evidence fixed by locked
      policy. The two commits must match except for the pinned historical safety-floor target.
- [x] Implement the fail-closed verifier. It rejects fork origins, abbreviated or unreviewed
      commits, dirty trees, local overrides, missing/expired/future/wrong-action packets, broad
      permissions, symlinks, duplicate-key JSON, missing or reused evidence hashes, and unsafe
      public receipt fields.
- [x] Route every mutable path through the gate before Wrangler. The no-shell Worker wrapper
      authorizes first, verifies exact npm 10.9.8 and Wrangler 4.112.0, performs a fresh
      zero-script install and Cloudflare build, and supports the pinned historical safety worktree
      without asking that old commit to contain the new gate. The staged D1 wrapper maps every
      mutation to one exact authorization action; both paths reauthorize immediately before the
      provider write, while read-only preflight/postflight remain separate.
- [x] Add adversarial authorization, checkout, wrapper-order, environment-sanitization, migration-
      mapping, policy-lock, and redaction tests; update the authoritative release, moderation,
      deployment, and incident-maintenance runbooks. A valid packet remains only an authorization
      boundary, never provider success, deployed-source, live-host, migration, or release evidence.
- [x] Complete the full clean repository verification and publish the exact head through a
      protected draft PR without running a production command.
      Local verification is green on exact Node 22.23.1/npm 10.9.8, including a fresh
      `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, Cloudflare build, 395/395 Node tests, 48/48 focused authorization
      and release tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit mobile tests, lint, TypeScript, full security
      policy/SBOM/provenance checks, and two zero-vulnerability npm audits. Python evidence is
      29/29 API tests on local 3.13.12 plus 18 migrations, 14 critical query plans, and every
      foreign-key child path indexed; Ruff; 81/81 pipeline tests on exact 3.12.13 with one
      documented optional-raster skip; and deterministic smoke. Hosted API CI remains the exact
      Python 3.13.14 authority. Protected draft PR `#111` at exact head
      `ec543d9be52d4b18fb88f588683df0547f53e9c2` passed PR CI `29695839861`, release
      provenance `29695839860`, and CodeQL `29695839366`, including 140/140 browser cases.
      Duplicate branch-push release provenance `29695817251` also passed. Branch-push CI
      `29695817225` initially passed 139/140 browser cases after one WebKit recovery-state flake;
      the unchanged head passed the complete PR browser matrix, the isolated case 10/10 locally,
      and branch-push attempt 2. No source weakening, production command, deployment, D1
      mutation, or Cloudflare change was used.
- [x] Merge only the accepted exact head and add the immutable protected-`main` receipt. PR
      `#111` merged as `3b44c5bc57d30a64c6576be99ebdb85182052013`. Main release provenance
      `29696345556` and CodeQL `29696345381` passed on their original attempts, including the
      deterministic release bundle plus release and CycloneDX SBOM attestations. Main CI
      `29696345544` attempt 1 passed 139/140 browser cases after hosted WebKit returned `NaN` for
      one computed `paddingTop` read rather than reporting a failed layout boundary; the exact
      case then passed 30/30 in a local WebKit stress repeat, and unchanged-main attempt 2 passed
      140/140 browser cases plus API, pipeline, dependency submission, security, lint,
      TypeScript, and unit gates. Open PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning
      alerts are all zero; issue `#86` remains open by design. Production remains active,
      drifted, and untouched. The broader P0 provider gate stays open for separately authorized
      migrations, bindings and feature flags, maintenance mode, source binding, live-host
      verification, and guarded release acceptance.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — Cloudflare provider-state hold

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main` and the provider state without mutation. Starting `main`
      is `c9bc1d839bbd8783fc77afba9af6f0f5054d8a45`; read-only Wrangler and dashboard evidence found
      one active version at all traffic, five domains, one cron trigger, maintenance mode off,
      and recent invocations.
- [x] Freeze the no-mutation, redaction, and hold contract. A disconnected Git build integration
      is not a paused Worker; public evidence cannot contain provider, account, author, database,
      namespace, etag, secret, or token identifiers; source binding and live-host verification
      remain private external gates.
- [x] Add the locked offline policy verifier and the separately confirmed live analyzer. It can
      execute only the exact deployment-status and active-version read commands, uses no shell,
      bounds and validates JSON, and cannot deploy, change traffic/routes/domains/secrets, or
      mutate D1.
- [x] Add adversarial coverage for weakened policy, missing confirmation, command widening,
      malformed and oversized output, split traffic, ambiguous identities, duplicate bindings,
      current drift, and receipt redaction. CI and release provenance run only the offline gate.
- [x] Complete local verification and capture the current fail-closed redacted audit receipt.
      At `2026-07-19T15:26:01.050Z` the read-only audit confirmed single-version traffic and
      compatibility parity, then correctly refused the hold/release claim because maintenance is
      off, two variables and six rate-limit bindings are missing, live-host proof is absent, and
      the reviewed commit is unbound. No private provider identifier or mutation entered the
      receipt. Evidence: exact Node 22.23.1/npm 10.9.8 Cloudflare build and 382/382 Node tests;
      140/140 Chromium/WebKit mobile, offline, recovery, 404, and safe-area cases; ESLint;
      TypeScript; the integrated security/SBOM gate and both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities;
      29/29 API tests on the locally available Python 3.13.12 compatible runtime; 18 migrations,
      14 critical query plans, and every foreign-key child path indexed; Ruff; 81/81 pipeline
      tests with one documented optional-raster skip; and deterministic smoke. Exact Python
      3.13.14 execution remains a hosted-CI gate because that local Homebrew interpreter is
      damaged, not because of a repository failure.
- [x] Publish protected draft PR `#108` from exact clean implementation head
      `32583bd7c21431d5ea772850e35d55d60eb595b4`. PR CI `29692895468`, release provenance
      `29692895484`, and CodeQL `29692894421` passed on their original attempts, including exact
      hosted Python 3.13.14, the new offline policy gate, the release bundle, and 140/140 browser
      cases. Duplicate branch-push CI `29692868584` and release provenance `29692868625` also
      passed, including a second 140/140 browser matrix. No retry, policy weakening, deployment,
      provider mutation, or Cloudflare change was used.
- [x] Merge only the accepted head and reconcile protected `main`. Final acceptance head
      `357571d2d638d733efea06a5addc2c1e6767180b` passed PR CI `29693134885`, release
      provenance `29693134884`, and CodeQL `29693133711` on their original attempts; duplicate
      branch-push CI `29693133460` and release provenance `29693133434` also passed without a
      retry. PR `#108` merged as `2ae4857a498afa525ecbcaf5bfa2fa53c199a647`; main CI
      `29693385952`, release provenance `29693385934`, and CodeQL `29693385780` passed that exact
      commit on their original attempts, including the 140-case browser matrix, hosted Python
      3.13.14 API and pipeline suites, dependency submission, release-bundle provenance, and
      release/SBOM attestations. Open PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning
      alerts are all zero; issue `#86` remains open by design. Production remains active,
      drifted, and untouched. The broader P0 provider deployment gate stays open for ordered
      migrations, bindings and feature flags, maintenance mode, source binding, live-host
      verification, and guarded release acceptance.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — deterministic mobile map readiness

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main` and freeze the acceptance boundary. Starting `main` is
      `698064d89952f0042ad7dd8853c9982cf3c63464`; Cloudflare and production remain paused, and
      this test-only cycle cannot claim deployment, provider, native-client, or production
      readiness.
- [x] Diagnose the repeated exact failure rather than changing product code. Two WebKit jobs on
      unchanged product bytes each passed 139/140 cases but timed out waiting for `Center Bay`;
      independent runs on the same commits passed, isolating a test-readiness race instead of a
      map geometry regression.
- [x] Freeze the non-weakening contract: keep the existing 15-second readiness ceiling, retain
      the exact overlay non-collision and viewport assertions, add no global retries, and exercise
      the real `Open interactive map` action whenever it is the authoritative visible state.
- [x] Replace the one-shot state sample and swallowed click failure with a bounded transition
      assertion. The test now scrolls through Playwright's actionability boundary, observes both
      loader and loaded states, performs a bounded user click when available, and fails if the map
      never reaches the real `Center Bay` control.
- [x] Complete local verification: 20/20 repeated WebKit map cases; 15/15 repeated Chromium map
      cases across three phone viewports; 140/140 full Chromium/WebKit mobile, offline, recovery,
      404, and safe-area cases; Cloudflare build and 374/374 Node tests; ESLint; TypeScript; the
      exact npm 10.9.8 integrated security/SBOM gate with zero audit findings; 29/29 API tests;
      18 migrations, 14 critical query plans, and every foreign-key child path indexed; Ruff;
      81/81 pipeline tests with one documented optional-raster skip; and deterministic smoke.
- [x] Publish protected PR `#106` from exact clean head
      `76e08f78fe891d3815a0762e0e152a53cf8fb099` after the complete local evidence above passed.
      Exact-head CI `29690657750`, release provenance `29690657737`, and CodeQL `29690656673`
      passed; the PR and duplicate branch-push web jobs both passed the full browser matrix on
      their original attempts. No retry, longer timeout, global retry, weakened assertion,
      deployment, provider mutation, or Cloudflare change was used.
- [x] Merge only the accepted exact head and reconcile protected `main`. PR `#106` merged as
      `172a13b52c2600c4c7d70e6cf18e86f61d6766c9`; main CI `29690916163`, release provenance
      `29690916184`, and CodeQL `29690916170` passed that exact commit on their original
      attempts, including the 140-case browser matrix, API and pipeline suites, dependency
      submission, release-bundle provenance, and release/SBOM attestations. Open PRs and
      Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are all zero; issue `#86` remains
      open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused. The broader mobile parent stays
      open for native PKCE/token work, isolated staging, provider bindings, physical-device
      acceptance, deployment, and production-scale evidence.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — authorship and public-asset provenance

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main` and freeze the public/private/legal boundary. Starting
      `main` is `ea922c8dfbdb7e35a81836d1f6a9e9e35c9081bb`; Git history is custody evidence,
      not proof of creation or ownership, and this cycle cannot make a copyright, trademark,
      assignment, counsel, deployment, or production-readiness claim.
- [x] Inventory all 15 shipped JPG, PNG, SVG, and WebP assets, their local hashes, Git custody
      history, current live copy, duplicate documentation, seven third-party source pages,
      creator/license metadata, and eight unresolved legacy brand/texture paths.
- [x] Freeze the strict JSON Schema, exact pre-policy legacy allowlist, canonical license map,
      source-review fields, private-evidence boundary, and `productionReadiness: false` policy.
      New public visual assets cannot inherit the legacy exception.
- [x] Add the fail-closed verifier and deterministic public-safe report. CI now rejects missing or
      duplicate records, symlinks, path/hash drift, new legacy exceptions, malformed or unknown
      licenses, missing source evidence, sensitive record values, live credit/license/change-copy
      drift, stale documentation, or a stale report.
- [x] Correct the shipped reference attribution: Frank Kovalchek replaces the incorrect USGS
      sandbar credit, Sharon Mollerus is the single pilings source, and Town of Chatham is retained
      in the Fish and Wildlife Service tidal-channel credit. The UI now links source and license
      separately and states the documented local transformation. Add the safe update process,
      legacy owner-confirmation questions, and the future artist-agreement checklist without
      committing contracts or private legal/business records.
- [x] Publish protected PR `#104` from exact head
      `854f9d249174ed2a01953a0bcde3906477af2af0`. Complete local evidence is green:
      Cloudflare build and 374/374 Node tests; 29/29 API tests; 18 migrations, 14 critical query
      plans, and every foreign-key child path indexed; Ruff and 81/81 pipeline tests with one
      documented optional-raster skip plus deterministic smoke; ESLint; TypeScript; secrets;
      zero-execution npm policy; exact Python locks; both SBOM gates; both npm audits with zero
      vulnerabilities; the focused provenance verifier/tests; and 140/140 Chromium/WebKit mobile,
      offline, recovery, 404, and safe-area cases. Exact-head CI `29676342215`, release provenance
      `29676342222`, CodeQL `29676341710`, and native image security `29676342217` passed. A
      duplicate push CI initially hit one WebKit map-control wait timeout; failed-job rerun
      `88165071812` passed on the unchanged head, matching the already-green PR run. No code or
      test weakening was used, and no deployment or Cloudflare change occurred.
- [x] Merge only the accepted exact head and reconcile protected `main`. PR `#104` merged as
      `9cb3bf12524bf17bf699bfc1508575ceee727db6`; main CI `29676832214`, release provenance
      `29676832217`, CodeQL `29676832077`, and native image security `29676832201` passed that
      exact commit, including the 140-case browser matrix, dependency submission,
      release-bundle provenance, release/SBOM attestations, and both image architectures. Open
      PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are all zero; issue `#86`
      remains open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused. The parent business-record
      goal stays open for owner confirmation of eight legacy assets, private evidence,
      assignments/contributor agreements, accepted-artifact archives, counsel, and the future
      operator dashboard.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — mobile web and API compatibility controls

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main` and freeze the acceptance boundary. Starting `main` is
      `a1dd23c85c9540cc86b52fd35942a7ebceeb53dd`; production and Cloudflare remain paused, issue
      `#86` remains open, and this cycle cannot claim native-client or production readiness.
- [x] Add an additive API compatibility contract. Existing first-party web requests may omit the
      header; opt-in clients must send exact version `1`, and incompatible or ambiguous values fail
      with a no-store `400` before rate limiting, body reads, authentication, routes, storage, or
      provider work. Every API response receives the centrally owned version header.
- [x] Complete the fixed-surface safe-area contract across top, right, bottom, and left insets,
      while retaining viewport fallbacks and dynamic viewport bounds. A rebuilt focused Chromium
      browser check passed deterministic simulated-inset geometry.
- [x] Expand the hosted mobile matrix from three Chromium viewports to those three plus a WebKit
      iPhone viewport. The existing offline/recovery suite plus the new inset test now enumerates
      140 browser cases; exact-head WebKit acceptance remains part of the protected PR gate.
- [x] Add the strict machine-readable policy, fail-closed verifier, focused runtime/static tests,
      and [mobile/API boundary](MOBILE-READINESS.md). The current secure host-cookie web model is
      preserved, browser credential storage remains forbidden, and PKCE/OS-protected token work is
      an explicit precondition for any native release.
- [x] Publish protected PR `#102` only after the complete local suite passed on exact head
      `6af7f91a4ca5f06c182e793818e87393edaeda12`. Evidence: Cloudflare build and 369/369 Node
      tests; 29/29 API tests; 18 migrations, 14 critical query plans, and every foreign-key child
      path indexed; Ruff and 81/81 pipeline tests with one documented optional-raster skip plus
      deterministic smoke; ESLint; TypeScript; secrets; zero-execution npm policy; exact Python
      locks; both SBOM gates; both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities; 105/105 local Chromium
      mobile/offline cases; and a 140-case four-project hosted matrix including WebKit. Exact-head
      CI `29673948911`, release provenance `29673948924`, and CodeQL `29673948165` passed; 13
      checks succeeded, five event-appropriate jobs skipped, and none failed. No deployment or
      Cloudflare change occurred.
- [x] Merge only the accepted exact head and reconcile protected `main`. PR `#102` merged as
      `fb2c23a254ee40a9d4abb47d905910e8eb66ccfd`; main CI `29674131431`, release provenance
      `29674131446`, and CodeQL `29674131178` passed that exact commit, including the WebKit
      matrix, dependency submission, release-bundle provenance, and release/SBOM attestations.
      Open PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are all zero; issue `#86`
      remains open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused. The parent roadmap item
      stays open for native PKCE/token work, isolated staging, provider bindings, physical-device
      acceptance, deployment, and production-scale evidence.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — default-off advisory AI review queue

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main`, the owner roadmap, and the highest-risk repository gap.
      Starting `main` is `bb3bdc4cef3bbd38370d14924803adf5ea6ed2b3`; production, Cloudflare,
      provider resources, and issue `#86` remain unchanged.
- [x] Recheck Cloudflare's current at-least-once delivery, explicit acknowledgement/retry,
      batching, retry ceiling, concurrency, and dead-letter behavior from primary documentation.
- [x] Inventory the complete advisory-review lifecycle across request creation, provider work,
      retries, deletion, maintenance, operator recovery, release migration, and observability.
- [x] Implement a fail-closed, production-default-off D1 outbox/lease consumer. Queue messages
      contain only an opaque job ID; work is idempotent, attempts are bounded at five, deletion
      wins, expired leases recover, and terminal failure becomes explicit `needs_attention`.
- [x] Add the strict message schema, policy verifier, migration/query-plan/release guards,
      redacted structured logging, non-executing operator replay plan, owner UI state, threat and
      access-control documentation, and adversarial runtime/policy coverage.
- [x] Publish protected PR `#100` only after the complete local suite passed on exact head
      `8b5f4059cf92b1364f856331ea5c3724c88cad7e`. Evidence: Cloudflare build and 366/366
      Node tests; 29/29 API tests; 18 migrations, 14 critical query plans, and every foreign-key
      child path indexed; Ruff and 81/81 pipeline tests with one documented optional-raster
      skip plus deterministic smoke; ESLint; TypeScript; secrets; zero-execution npm policy;
      exact Python locks; both SBOM gates; both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities; and clean
      exact-commit privacy-rights and operational-restore drills that correctly remained
      production-closed. Exact-head CI `29672461273`, release provenance `29672461228`, CodeQL
      `29672460408`, and native image security `29672461239` passed; 15 checks succeeded, five
      event-appropriate jobs skipped, and none failed.
- [x] Merge only the accepted exact head and reconcile protected `main`. PR `#100` merged as
      `1ffe0bcbd46ebbf518747ca26abb8d348c06624e`; main CI `29672574145`, release provenance
      `29672574141`, CodeQL `29672574061`, and native image security `29672574136` passed that
      exact commit. Open PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are all
      zero; issue `#86` remains open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused, the
      queue flag remains false, and no provider queue or binding was created.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — isolated security-exercise guard

- [x] Reconcile exact protected `main` and the prioritized roadmap. Starting `main` is
      `983752ae8950c6611e0a943e3bb33527e7871e3b`; L10 isolated-staging DAST preparation is the
      highest-risk repository work that can advance without touching paused production.
- [x] Inventory the dynamic attack surface and preserve the hard boundary: no production host,
      alias, binding, user data, provider call, deployment, DNS change, load test, or intrusive
      scan is authorized by this cycle.
- [x] Freeze the maintained primary scanner approach and supply-chain identity. OWASP ZAP
      2.17.0 is locked to image-index digest
      `sha256:8d387b1a63e3425beef4846e39719f5af2a787753af2d8b6558c6257d7a577a2`;
      the runner uses the Automation Framework with fixed scope, duration, rate, and resource
      ceilings and never pulls implicitly. The pinned image accepted the generated active plan
      with `zap.sh -cmd -autocheck` and exit 0 while Docker networking was disabled.
- [x] Implement the production-refusing private authorization contract, staging-only health
      marker/version preflight, passive/public-active plan generator, hardened Docker command,
      private evidence boundary, and aggregate-only receipt that can never claim production
      readiness by itself.
- [x] Add adversarial coverage for production aliases/subdomains, hostile URLs, active-loopback
      and IP targets, stale/oversized windows, every safety assertion, extra/private fields,
      redirect/header/marker/version mismatch, fixed scan limits, missing confirmation,
      no-subprocess-on-refusal, private-file permissions/symlinks, and receipt redaction.
- [x] Pass the full clean repository/security suite, publish protected PR `#98` at exact head
      `c95816d2dc55d4f8a046c1c22d1f4aecab34936d`, and accept every exact-head gate without
      deploying. Evidence: CI `29669614571` including dependency review, release provenance
      `29669614572`, CodeQL `29669613529`, and native image security `29669614580` passed; 15
      checks succeeded, five event-appropriate jobs skipped, and none failed. Local evidence
      also passed the Cloudflare build and 351/351 Node tests, 29/29 API tests, 81/81 pipeline
      tests with one documented optional-raster skip, Ruff, ESLint, TypeScript, D1 query plans,
      secrets, zero-execution install policy, exact Python locks, both SBOM checks, both npm
      audits with zero vulnerabilities, and the network-disabled pinned-ZAP plan check.
- [x] Merge only the accepted exact head and reconcile protected `main`. PR `#98` merged as
      `fb4662cf725c3a1f99b4e918a19c6e72971a6b85`; main CI `29669810196`, release provenance
      `29669810179`, CodeQL `29669809994`, and native image security `29669810191` passed that
      exact commit. Open PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are all
      zero; issue `#86` remains open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused. L10
      remains explicitly open for isolated provider resources, written independent
      authorization, public/authenticated/manual testing, remediation/retest, and independent
      acceptance.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — privacy-rights case handling

- [x] Reconcile the exact protected `main` after the source-admissibility receipt. Evidence:
      `main` is `9ad0ab8aa4bafd3e73253f382a5f23bb363358f7`; CI `29665671557`, release
      provenance `29665671589`, and CodeQL `29665671354` passed; open PRs and all three alert
      classes were empty; issue `#86` remains open by design.
- [x] Audit active-row, public-copy, object, ledger, browser, validation, log, provider, and
      backup deletion semantics. Immediate active deletion is already the stronger public
      promise; no recoverable 30-day account copy is currently authorized.
- [x] Recheck primary EU, UK, and California clock sources and freeze a conservative rule:
      always use the 28-calendar-day internal target, never infer jurisdictional applicability,
      and require recorded legal review before selecting a statute-specific clock reference.
- [x] Freeze a strict case schema and default-deny policy that reject extra fields and prohibit
      raw identifiers, contact details, credentials, precise location, notes, photos, object
      locators, and request/response text. Canonical policy SHA-256:
      `a87dee0cf45f35e9da35c4557ee0fff9040c02e0a333996383919b52c1592334`.
- [x] Implement the non-mutating evaluator/CLI and synthetic offline drill. Focused evidence:
      21/21 schema, lifecycle, cross-contract, chronology, export-before-erasure, closure,
      private-file, aggregate-receipt, and fail-closed production-gate tests pass. The clean,
      exact implementation commit `140c45da18bf1fdd87780c450a16139ee60a9a71` produced a private
      aggregate-only drill receipt with SHA-256
      `98aee26f45a1ad3351c4cb7da81887220d9b5522e0900b0667e91c454748d1b1` and
      `production_ready: false`.
- [x] Publish protected PR `#96` and accept every exact-head check without deploying or changing
      Cloudflare. Exact head `140c45da18bf1fdd87780c450a16139ee60a9a71` passed CI
      `29666895832`, release provenance `29666895835`, CodeQL `29666895407`, and native image
      security `29666895825`; 15 checks passed, five event-appropriate jobs skipped, and none
      failed. Local evidence also passed the Cloudflare build and 338/338 Node tests, 29/29 API
      tests with all 13 critical query plans, Ruff, 81/81 pipeline tests with one documented
      optional-raster skip, deterministic smoke, 102/102 mobile-browser tests, lint, TypeScript,
      secrets, zero-execution install policy, every exact Python lock, both SBOM checks, and both
      npm audits with zero vulnerabilities.
- [x] Merge only after all required checks pass, then reconcile exact `main`, post-merge runs,
      PR/issue/alert state, and an immutable receipt update. PR `#96` merged as
      `b0931deaefc43e434eb28d5f43b55da9599901c1`; main CI `29667029304`, release provenance
      `29667029303`, CodeQL `29667029205`, and native image security `29667029297` passed that
      exact commit. Open PRs and Dependabot, code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are all
      zero; issue `#86` remains open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — source admissibility

- [x] Reconcile the exact protected `main` after the model-governance receipt cycle. Evidence:
      `main` is `7a3ca95fe5449bc9b41dab9a0fe0a33ceaaaf237`; CI `29658714106`, release
      provenance `29658714150`, and CodeQL `29658714078` passed; open PRs and all three alert
      classes were empty; issue `#86` remains open by design.
- [x] Inventory every current source manifest and synthetic fixture, then review the current
      official Fishbrain and Meta terms without acquiring CDFW, social, private-group, profile,
      credential, or user-account data.
- [x] Freeze a strict source-admissibility JSON Schema and default-deny policy covering the exact
      manifest inventory, allowed preprocessing operations, current all-false supervised-model
      training, validation, and production-scoring roles, synthetic-test boundary, and
      Fishbrain/Facebook prohibitions. Canonical policy SHA-256:
      `54b245191ad8da6dac820e189a6a21834ccca7699e0ced7bcc29c7bf430cf817`.
- [x] Enforce the policy in the source-manifest loader, official CDFW context verifier,
      observation normalization, bathymetry ingestion, and terrain-pretraining entry points.
      Unknown sources, extra manifests, wrong operations, retrospective social content,
      credentials, automation, identity collection, and all current model roles fail closed.
- [x] Add semantic and cross-language adversarial tests plus owner-facing Fishbrain/Facebook and
      official-data guidance. Evidence: 81/81 executable pipeline tests pass with one documented
      optional-raster skip; 5/5 cross-language contract tests pass; Ruff passes.
- [x] Pass the complete local repository/security/lock/SBOM suite, publish protected PR `#94`,
      and accept every required check on exact head
      `8440158e5b7d8a7be71807310c710911e2f062ed`. Evidence: CI `29662734186`, release
      provenance `29662734148`, CodeQL `29662733032`, optional Python research
      `29662734176`, and native image security `29662734152` passed; 17 checks passed, five
      event-appropriate jobs skipped, and none failed. Local evidence also passed the Cloudflare
      build and 325/325 Node tests, 29/29 API tests in a fresh hash-pinned environment, Ruff,
      ESLint, TypeScript, secrets, the zero-execution install policy, all exact Python locks,
      both SBOM checks, and both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities.
- [x] Merge only after every required check passes, then reconcile exact implementation `main`
      `9f41e1afbafd907ee884cc8d6682e8d759182110`. Evidence: CI `29662858447`, release
      provenance `29662858449`, CodeQL dispatch `29662858267`, optional Python research
      `29662858432`, and native image security `29662858463` passed; open PRs and Dependabot,
      code-scanning, and secret-scanning alerts are empty; issue `#86` remains open by design.
      Cloudflare and production remain paused.

## Completed seven-step work cycle — model governance

- [x] Reconcile the exact protected `main` after the API-image renewal cycle. Evidence: `main` is
      `a3242e4369c970500835fa88ce187e670e623385`; CI `29655454304`, release-provenance
      `29655454306`, and CodeQL `29655454277` passed; open PRs and all three alert classes are
      empty; issue `#86` remains open for its mandatory 2026-08-04 review.
- [x] Inventory the existing model-run, opportunity, validation-v1, feasibility-v2, and model-card
      boundaries without treating the inactive protocols or terrain experiments as validation.
- [x] Freeze a strict, target-specific v1 governance policy and JSON Schema covering sequential
      stages, preregistered relational promotion gates, monitoring privacy/cadence, suppression,
      rollback, revalidation, and audit identity.
- [x] Implement a fail-closed evaluator and CLI that hash the policy, reject ambiguous evidence,
      suppress unauthorized trained serving, and never apply a promotion or restoration.
- [x] Document the operator decision matrix and pass focused schema, semantic, CLI, and Ruff
      checks. Evidence: 5/5 cross-language schema tests and 7/7 governance tests pass; canonical
      policy SHA-256 is `dac940bd123a2e6505cc20d535f28e7c84a585f9f3e5cd82efce06eae57f47a5`.
- [x] Publish protected PR `#92` at exact head
      `a83028558b39c145587279a984bfd906cd2625df` and accept every exact-head gate. Evidence: CI
      `29658229300` including dependency review, release provenance `29658229310`, CodeQL
      `29658228654`, optional research `29658229306`, and native image security `29658229337`
      passed; 17 checks passed, five event-appropriate jobs skipped, and none failed. Local
      evidence also passed 75/75 executable pipeline tests with one optional-raster skip, the
      Cloudflare build and 325/325 Node tests, Ruff, ESLint, TypeScript, repository security,
      lock, and SBOM checks.
- [x] Merge only after every required check passes, then reconcile exact implementation `main`
      `e74c2bd97fbb2fce1c9fabddf446ba2182b65a51`. Evidence: CI `29658373069`, release provenance
      `29658373025`, CodeQL `29658372800`, optional research `29658373038`, and native image
      security `29658373034` passed; open PRs and all three alert classes are empty; issue `#86`
      remains open by design. Cloudflare and production remain paused.

## Completed prior seven-step cycle — API image exception deadline

- [x] Reconcile the required handoff, exact `main`, open PRs/issues, Dependabot alerts, and
      post-merge workflows. Evidence: `main` is `e58a7f50359fc3e41f37e5ad168b9ecf089b50b8`,
      PRs and Dependabot alerts are empty, issue `#86` is the sole open issue, and CI,
      release-provenance, and CodeQL all passed that exact commit.
- [x] Re-check official Python and CPython sources. Python 3.13.14 remains the latest stable
      3.13 release; the three security fixes have upstream/backport PRs but no containing stable
      3.13 release; PEP 719 schedules Python 3.13.15 for 2026-08-04.
- [x] Re-check the Docker Official Image source and public registry. The selected tag still maps
      to source revision `f79aea5b8f6b2d65b31ba2bb3f69c0c2083345c8`, index digest

- [x] Implement the bounded fallback without weakening mitigations: named security owner,
      mandatory 2026-08-04 re-review, 2026-08-08 hard expiry, primary-source binding, at most
      seven days of post-release grace, immediate stable-series-fix rejection, and preserved
      `tarfile`/`html.parser` removal plus import guards. Focused contract tests pass 16/16.
- [x] Pass the complete local repository, API, pipeline, security, SBOM, build, and mobile gates.
      Evidence: 325/325 repository tests, 29/29 API tests plus all 13 critical query plans,
      69/69 pipeline tests with one documented optional raster skip, 102/102 mobile-browser
      tests, lint, typecheck, secrets, exact Python locks, zero-execution npm policy, both SBOM
      checks, and both npm audits with zero vulnerabilities.
- [x] Publish the protected draft PR and accept fresh native AMD64/ARM64 image evidence plus all
      required checks on the exact head. PR `#90` head

      mandatory 2026-08-04 re-review. Cloudflare and production remain paused.

## Completed prior seven-step cycle — official fisheries data

- [x] Reconcile PR `#87`, its exact post-merge checks, and the zero-open-alert repository state.
- [x] Inventory the existing CDFW, CRFS, and RecFIN contracts without ingesting private or
      social data.
- [x] Verify the current ds3185/ds3186 official service identities, revisions, dictionaries,
      sampling boundaries, license labels, and export drift.
- [x] Acquire and twice reproduce canonical owner-only snapshots with byte-binding receipts and
      a fail-closed acquisition command.
- [x] Verify support and allowed-use boundaries. Local evidence: 69/69 pipeline tests passed
      (one documented optional raster test skipped), 324/324 repository tests passed, Ruff,
      lint, typecheck, offline dependency audits, secrets, locks, and both SBOM checks passed.
- [x] Publish PR `#88` and obtain hosted network-audit and 102/102 mobile-browser evidence.
      API, dependency review, both pinned Python stacks, CodeQL for Actions/JavaScript/Python,
      pipeline, web, and release-provenance checks all passed on the exact PR commit.
- [x] Merge only after every required hosted check passes and reconcile the exact main commit.
      PR `#88` merged as `5b221f59c39f69d939f144f99a3ea81226e8908d`; post-merge CI

      `29645959414` all passed. Dependabot remained at zero open alerts. Cloudflare and
      production remain paused.

## Completed earlier seven-step cycle

- [x] Triage PRs `#17`–`#32`; close unsafe, broken, duplicated, or superseded updates.
- [x] Upgrade and lock maintained runtimes and direct dependency families.
- [x] Produce and independently verify deterministic signed release provenance.
- [x] Produce the combined npm/Python/API-image/Worker/D1/assets release inventory and SBOM.
- [x] Accept the native AMD64/ARM64 API-image package, license, and vulnerability gate.
- [x] Run the clean-commit synthetic non-production restore/deletion-replay drill and preserve
      only private aggregate evidence. Production data, provider access, key custody, real-backup
      recovery, and second-person approval remain explicitly false.
- [x] Create this status dashboard, re-run the safe offline observability/performance/SEO and
      mobile checks, and preserve UI/brand work as the final priority. Verification: 319/319
      repository tests, 17/17 focused observability/scale/SEO tests, and 102/102 mobile tests.

## P0 — Immediate safety and launch integrity

- [x] Establish the cross-functional baseline audit and truthful model-claim rules.
- [ ] Prevent AI-generated trip summaries from publishing without explicit human approval.
      **Local complete;** guarded production migration/deployment, legacy-row audit, and live
      smoke evidence remain.
- [ ] Release production hardening: headers, health/security endpoints, abuse controls,
      sanitized logs, migrations, alerts, backup verification, and restore readiness.
      **Local implementation and synthetic restore drill complete;** Cloudflare deployment,
      rate-limit/WAF/Turnstile activation, alert delivery, key custody, and independent review
      remain.
- [ ] Make account privacy promises durable across active rows, public copies, objects,
      deletion queues, exports, receipts, retries, and restored data. **Local complete;**
      production migration/provider/counsel evidence remains.
- [ ] Complete defense-in-depth security and authorization review: session cookies, access
      matrix and ownership predicates, schema/input/output/upload/prompt boundaries, endpoint
      abuse ceilings, password safety, encryption/custody, version locks, SBOMs, provenance,
      vulnerability response, restore testing, and authorized staging penetration testing.
      **Most repository controls complete; the 13-layer owner reference mapping and zero-execution
      npm install-script boundary are locally complete;** production/provider/staging gates remain,
      including isolated DAST, active edge filtering, live detection/alerting, key custody, and
      independent review.
- [ ] Complete the privacy lifecycle: data inventory, cascade map, deletion semantics,
      retention decision, rights workflows, processor handling, and counsel approval. **Local
      inventory/cascade/deletion checks complete;** the optional 30-day recovery decision and
      external legal/provider drills remain.
- [ ] Provide and drill safe maintenance mode on every production hostname. **Local complete;**
      production activation, stale-client recovery, and captured evidence remain.

## P1 — Evidence, data contracts, discoverability, and scale

- [ ] Establish privacy-preserving production observability and an operator console, including
      structured logs, request IDs, redaction, searchable failures, alerts, backup/privacy-job
      views, immutable changes, and a separately authorized future financial domain. **Local
      logging schema/runbook and fail-closed offline request/Queue/scheduled reconstruction drill
      plus the source-bound activation-evidence verifier are complete;** the incident receipt
      omits actor pseudonyms and raw payloads, while the public-safe activation receipt exposes
      only its independently expected reviewed commit and aggregate gate results—never evidence
      hashes, saved-view names, provider identifiers, or raw payloads. The activation verifier
      refuses a missing or mismatched expected commit and requires structured-only logs, access
      review, retention/cost ownership, delivered/acknowledged/closed/redaction-tested alerts, uptime,
      preview/production reconstruction, and pseudonym-key separation within 72 hours; it neither
      queries a provider nor authorizes production. Preview/production evidence, provider
      dashboard, access, retention, cost, uptime, and delivered-alert evidence remain. PostHog
      remains deferred pending privacy review.
- [ ] Make data and execution paths measurably scalable: query plans/indexes, bounded access,
      cache matrix, justified asynchronous work, D1-managed connections, optional API pooling,
      and isolated load/soak/spike/failure tests. **A complete static inventory now covers all 221
      Worker prepare sites, and exact 100-item saved-location/gear-preset account ceilings now
      fail closed on overflow without truncating rights exports, while local query/index/cache/
      connection contracts, production-refusing harness, the default-off advisory Queue adapter,
      and a default-off complete privacy-export adapter with an opaque message, owner-bound D1
      lease ledger, private 24-hour object, progress UI, bounded expiry/retries, and account-delete
      race adoption are complete;** migrations, provider Queue/DLQ/R2 bindings, IAM/alerts,
      export activation, staging measurements,
      child-cascade cost evidence, failure injection,
      rollback evidence, and authorized penetration testing remain.
      Local acceptance for the default-off export adapter passed the Cloudflare build and
      456/456 Node tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit mobile cases, ESLint, TypeScript, the complete
      security/SBOM/query-inventory chain and both zero-vulnerability npm audits, 29/29 API tests,
      the 19-plan D1/index contract, Ruff, 81/81 pipeline tests with one documented optional-
      raster skip, and deterministic pipeline smoke. This is repository evidence only; no
      migration, Queue, R2, variable, deployment, or production request was made.
- [ ] Freeze and deploy the species-aware observation/model-run contract. **Local contract
      complete;** production migration, legacy-row audit, and first approved ingestion manifest
      remain.
- [ ] Freeze and govern the validation protocol. **v1 correctly inactive; v2 and the 730-day
      technical candidate are locally complete;** policy/key/schedule/legal review, external
      preregistration, witnessed restore, and activation remain.
- [ ] Acquire reproducible official CDFW/CRFS/RecFIN data with manifests, checksums, licenses,
      dictionaries, sampling support, and allowed-use declarations; begin a prospective cohort.
      **Exact aggregate ds3186/ds3185 snapshots and receipts complete;** both are context-only,
      while a complete-effort RecFIN export and the prospective cohort remain open.
- [ ] Treat Fishbrain only as an optional written-license partnership and Facebook groups only
      as admin-approved prospective recruitment—never scraped retrospective evidence.
      **Local default-deny policy/schema/loader and operation gates complete;** written platform
      permissions or license, administrator approval, direct participant opt-in, legal/privacy
      review, and any separately protected policy change remain open. No social data was acquired.
- [ ] Validate California halibut relative ranking against frozen baselines and publish
      uncertainty, limitations, negative results, and the current all-zero sample constraint.
      **Public all-zero status locally complete:** the machine-bound disclosure states that no
      prospective study is activated, eligible prospective/confirmatory attempts, encounters,
      non-encounters, preregistered baseline comparisons, and probability-calibration runs are
      all zero, and the non-promoted terrain-probe result is explicitly not live-score evidence.
      Guarded deployment remains open, and actual performance validation cannot begin until a
      separately preregistered confirmatory study has eligible locked evidence.
- [ ] Define model promotion, drift, rollback, monitoring, and revalidation gates. **Local
      policy, schema, evaluator, CLI, and operator runbook complete;** the separate confirmatory
      protocol, eligible locked-test evidence, independent review, staged serving exercises,
      provider monitoring, and deployed release binding remain open.
- [ ] Establish truthful technical SEO and measurement. **Local crawl set, canonicals,
      metadata, social previews, JSON-LD, robots, sitemap, noindex, asset/font cleanup, and
      runbook complete;** deployment, Google/Bing verification/submission, coverage, Core Web
      Vitals, and privacy-reviewed funnel baselines remain.
- [ ] Make infrastructure mobile-ready with shared schemas, appropriate authentication,
      queue-based work, staging, bounded retries/costs, and WebKit/offline/safe-area coverage.
      **Local compatibility control implemented:** API responses advertise compatibility version
      `1`; opt-in incompatible clients fail before expensive work; current secure-cookie web
      clients remain compatible; shared schemas are inventoried; fixed surfaces consume all four
      safe-area insets; and hosted CI runs the mobile/offline suite on Chromium and WebKit. Native
      PKCE/token work, isolated staging, physical-device acceptance, provider bindings, deployment,
      and production-scale evidence remain open.

## P2 — Species and business expansion

- [ ] Add pollution and water-quality conditions to a separately versioned score component only
      after its meaning, official/licensed sources, spatial and temporal support, freshness,
      uncertainty, missing-data behavior, and validation gates are frozen. Agency advisories stay
      authoritative; the product must not turn a fishing score into a water-contact or seafood-
      consumption safety claim. **First local advisory slice complete:** the versioned SFPUC
      policy maps six exact San Francisco sites, binds its policy/collector/catalog hashes,
      fails stale, incomplete, unmonitored, unavailable, and unmapped status to unknown, gives
      no score credit for a no-posting result, and suppresses recommendations under an active
      official status without rewriting the attested fishing score. Broader Bay Area and
      remaining launch-catalog source coverage, rainfall semantics, numeric-contribution
      validation, independent review, deployment, and post-deployment freshness evidence remain
      open.
      **Second local advisory slice implemented:** the fixed California State Water Resources
      Control Board BeachWatch action table covers all 14 South Coast sites for explicit
      countywide actions and 11 through direct station mappings. Only active closures, postings,
      or rain actions suppress; absence stays unknown, every `scoreDelta` remains null, and the
      live adapter check is time-bound repository evidence. Independent mapping/source-latency
      review, remaining launch-catalog coverage, full local/hosted acceptance, guarded deployment,
      and every numeric-score gate remain open.
      **San Francisco gap audit locally complete:** a fixed-endpoint receipt records the four
      nearest official station candidates for each still-unmapped waterfront site but deliberately
      creates no mappings. Candidate distances range from 792 m to 2,520 m and station identities
      differ, so all four sites stay `not-covered`, unknown, and null-score pending separately
      documented spatial authority and independent review.
- [ ] Enrich the map one available location at a time with reviewed notable structure and useful
      depth levels. Every feature needs reproducible official/licensed source provenance, units,
      vertical datum, resolution, retrieval date, checksum, uncertainty, allowed use, sensitive-
      habitat review, and per-location visual/data acceptance; unmapped locations remain clearly
      incomplete instead of receiving invented detail.
- [ ] Add striped bass as the first distinct estuary/migration beta.
- [ ] Add defensible rockfish complexes, cabezon, and surfperch groups, each with its own source
      inventory, model card, validation gate, and regulation treatment.
- [ ] Complete business/legal readiness before promotion or revenue: entity/DBA, tax/local
      license, trademark, counsel/CPA, DMCA/UGC, and insurance review.
- [ ] Preserve authorship and business evidence: dated decisions, source/asset provenance,
      licenses/assignments, contributor agreements, release hashes, archived public artifacts,
      and counsel-guided copyright/trademark/patent/trade-secret decisions. **Local public-asset
      register, strict schema/policy, fail-closed hash/license/live-copy verifier, deterministic
      public-safe report, and owner/artist workflow are complete;** eight legacy brand/texture
      paths still need private owner evidence, and agreements, archived public artifacts,
      counsel decisions, and operator-console integration remain open.

## P3 — Experience and brand (intentionally last)

- [ ] Complete accessibility and interaction review: keyboard/screen reader, zoom/reflow,
      contrast, reduced motion, and a non-map path.
- [x] Add the branded accessible, noindex, non-cacheable `404` page and home action.
- [ ] Finish truthful operation-specific loading/progress/retry/cancel/reconnection states.
      **Route, profile, trip, deletion, edit, gear, sign-out, and saved-location safety states are
      locally complete;** only APIs that can report real progress may receive detailed progress.
- [ ] Add per-file photo upload states: visible glow plus copy shift, thumbnail, type, size,
      validation, independent progress/retry/cancel, and honest indeterminate state. Photos stay
      disabled until storage/privacy/security gates pass.
- [ ] Refresh visual design, graphics, species art, empty states, social cards, and brand
      illustration. Artist collaboration remains deferred until higher-risk work is complete.

## Product-owner work that is safe while production changes remain on hold

- [ ] Audit MFA/passkeys and recovery methods for GitHub, Cloudflare, the domain registrar,
      primary email, Google Search Console, and Bing Webmaster Tools. Store recovery codes
      offline; never paste them into Codex, GitHub, or a dashboard note.
- [ ] Choose the independent technical reviewer for restore/key-custody evidence. They should
      review aggregate receipts and the runbook, never receive production data or secret bytes.
- [ ] Choose an alert destination and escalation owner: monitored email/phone, acknowledgement
      expectation, backup contact, and quiet-hours policy.
- [ ] Make a private business-record folder for formation/tax/license questions, counsel/CPA
      notes, trademark research, insurance quotes, contracts, invoices, and renewal dates.
      Treat these as questions for qualified professionals, not completed legal conclusions.
- [x] Start an authorship/provenance register: all 15 public visual assets now have exact hashes,
      source/rights/release fields, AI-assistance state, evidence references, and a strict CI gate.
      Eight pre-policy brand/texture paths correctly remain `owner_confirmation_required`; keep
      their private source files, assignments, and legal notes outside Git.
- [ ] Before using your artist friend’s work, agree in writing on scope, credit, payment,
      ownership/license, modification rights, source-file delivery, and whether portfolio use is
      allowed. Actual visual commissioning can wait until P3.
- [x] Prepare an SEO language sheet: all four public pages now have machine-checked audience
      questions, honest purpose, candidate phrases, current titles/descriptions, desired snippets,
      useful next actions, and prohibited-claim groups in `seo/language-policy.json`, with the
      owner workflow in `docs/SEO_LANGUAGE_AND_EVIDENCE.md`. Provider actions remain fail closed;
      no DNS, dashboard, submission, inspection, indexing, or production change was made.
- [ ] Record current Google/Bing dashboard ownership and verification status with screenshots
      that contain no secrets. Leave sitemap submission and live URL inspection for deployment.
- [x] Build the official-data source register for CDFW/CRFS/RecFIN: dataset name, official URL,
      owner, retrieval method, license/terms, dictionary, update cadence, and intended use. Do
      not ingest private/social data. The register and exact ds3185/ds3186 receipts are in
      `docs/OFFICIAL-FISHERIES-DATA.md` and `pipeline/sources/receipts/`; neither aggregate is
      approved for training, validation, scoring, or point labels.
- [x] Draft five short user-interview scripts focused on whether people understand the
      heuristic ranking, freshness labels, limitations, and trip-report privacy. The fictional,
      machine-checked scripts in `docs/USER-INTERVIEWS.md` require no account or real trip,
      prohibit recordings and participant-level notes, and permit only aggregate non-identifying
      comprehension tallies. Execution remains unauthorized, and the work is explicitly not
      model-validation, catch-outcome, safety, access, legality, freshness, or accuracy evidence.
      Local acceptance passed the Cloudflare build and 406/406 Node tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit
      browser cases, ESLint, TypeScript, the locked security/SBOM/provenance chain and both zero-
      vulnerability npm audits, 29/29 API tests plus the D1 query/index contract, Ruff, 81/81
      pipeline tests with one documented optional-raster skip, and deterministic smoke.
- [ ] Track operating costs and receipts by provider in a simple accounting ledger. Keep this
      separate from application logs and analytics; a financial dashboard comes later.
      **Local workbook control complete:** the blank six-sheet XLSX template and machine-checked
      boundary reserve 200 formula-driven ledger rows, controlled provider/category/status fields,
      opaque private receipt references, monthly reconciliation checks, and explicit repository
      exclusions for filled ledgers and financial documents. The item stays open until the owner
      copies the template outside Git, records every current provider cost or explicit zero-cost
      confirmation, associates privately stored receipts, and completes the first reconciliation.
      No actual financial record, dashboard integration, billing action, provider mutation, or
      production change is included. Local acceptance passed formula inspection with zero errors,
      visual QA of all six sheets, the hash-bound workbook check, the Cloudflare build and 410/410
      Node tests, 140/140 Chromium/WebKit browser cases, ESLint, TypeScript, the locked
      security/SBOM/provenance chain and both zero-vulnerability npm audits, 29/29 API tests plus
      the D1 query/index contract, Ruff, 81/81 pipeline tests with one documented optional-raster
      skip, and deterministic smoke.

## Do not do yet

- Do not reconnect Git deployments, change production DNS, deploy, change Worker traffic,
      routes, domains, triggers, or variables, migrate D1, provision production secrets, enable
      Turnstile, or submit the sitemap until the guarded release checklist reaches those steps.
- Do not enable photos, public discussions, AI auto-publication, the validation pilot, or
      PostHog/session replay.
- Do not run load, stress, vulnerability scanning, or penetration testing against
      `castingcompass.com` or any production data. Use only an explicitly authorized isolated
      staging target later.
- Do not paste passwords, tokens, cookies, key material, recovery codes, private exports,
      user data, or unredacted provider screenshots into Codex, GitHub, logs, or PRs.
