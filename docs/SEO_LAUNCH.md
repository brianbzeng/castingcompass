# SEO launch gate

CastingCompass SEO is a staged product operation, not one checkbox. Local crawl
readiness, the reviewed production release, search-engine ownership/submission,
and observed indexing are separate evidence milestones. Do not claim that a page
is indexed merely because it appears in a sitemap or an indexing request was sent.

## Current scope and claims

The intended indexable set is deliberately small:

- `https://castingcompass.com/`
- `https://castingcompass.com/privacy`
- `https://castingcompass.com/terms`
- `https://castingcompass.com/ai-disclosure`

`/profile`, APIs, preview hosts, and generated data assets are not search landing
pages. The homepage may describe explainable **relative rankings** for California
halibut opportunity windows. It must not describe the live heuristic configuration
as a trained catch-probability model or imply that access, regulations, safety, or
catch outcomes are guaranteed.

## Milestone 1 — local crawl foundation

- [x] Each public page has one HTTPS self-canonical and route-specific title,
      description, Open Graph, and Twitter metadata.
- [x] `/profile` has a self-canonical plus `noindex, nofollow` and is omitted from
      the sitemap. It remains crawlable so robots can observe the `noindex`.
- [x] `robots.txt` allows public crawling and names the XML sitemap.
- [x] `sitemap.xml` contains exactly the four public pages with absolute HTTPS URLs.
- [x] The homepage publishes narrow `WebSite` JSON-LD only; no ratings, accuracy,
      business status, products, FAQs, or dataset claims are invented.
- [x] Automated tests enforce the rendered and static crawl contract.

Google recommends `WebSite` structured data on the homepage for a preferred site
name and warns that a robots-blocked page can hide its `noindex` directive. See
[site names](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/site-names) and
[robots meta directives](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag).

## Milestone 2 — reviewed production release

- [ ] Complete the P0 release gate first, including the canonical HTTP-to-HTTPS
      redirect, security/API noindex headers, remote CI, alerts, backup, restore,
      and staged migration evidence.
- [ ] Deploy this SEO commit through the immutable Worker release process.
- [ ] Fetch all four pages, `/profile`, `/robots.txt`, and `/sitemap.xml` from the
      apex, `www`, legacy aliases, and the exact Worker host. Record status,
      redirect, canonical, robots, sitemap, and structured-data evidence without
      user or account data.
- [ ] Confirm `/profile` is `noindex, nofollow`, is not in the sitemap, and is not
      blocked by `robots.txt`.

Google's sitemap guidance requires absolute canonical URLs and does not require
`lastmod`; omit it until the value can be maintained accurately. See
[Build and submit a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap).

## Milestone 3 — Google Search Console

- [ ] Add or select the `castingcompass.com` **Domain property**.
- [ ] Copy Google's ownership TXT value into Cloudflare DNS and retain the record.
      Do not commit a verification value to this repository.
- [ ] Submit `https://castingcompass.com/sitemap.xml`.
- [ ] Inspect and live-test the four public URLs, then request indexing.
- [ ] Inspect `/profile` only to confirm `noindex`; do not request indexing.
- [ ] Record Page Indexing, sitemap, Performance, and Core Web Vitals baselines.
      Zero impressions and “not enough data” are valid initial results.

See Google's [ownership verification](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080),
[URL Inspection](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289), and
[Core Web Vitals report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520).

## Milestone 4 — Bing Webmaster Tools

- [ ] Prefer importing the verified Google property; otherwise complete Bing's
      own ownership verification without committing a token.
- [ ] Submit or confirm the imported sitemap.
- [ ] Use Live URL inspection for the four public pages and request indexing.
- [ ] Confirm `/profile` reports `noindex`.
- [ ] Record the initial Site Explorer and SEO Reports state after Bing has data.

See Bing's [site verification](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/add-and-verify-site-12184f8b),
[sitemap guidance](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/sitemaps-3b5cf6ed), and
[URL Inspection](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/URL-Inspection-55a30305).

IndexNow is optional after the snapshot pipeline can notify only genuinely changed
public URLs. It is not required for this launch gate and does not guarantee indexing.

## Measurement and privacy

Search Console and Bing performance reports are the first acquisition baseline.
Do not add browser analytics merely to finish this checklist. Any future funnel
measurement needs a defined purpose, minimal event set, retention period, provider
review, legal disclosure, and a test proving that no precise location, trip content,
email, account identifier, or free text enters analytics.

Track only aggregate launch signals initially: valid indexed pages, crawl errors,
search impressions, clicks, query themes, branded versus non-branded discovery,
device class, and Core Web Vitals eligibility. Search-engine submission is not a
promise of ranking, traffic, or indexing.
